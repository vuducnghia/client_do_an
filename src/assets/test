NOTE Confidence: 0.9561559

00:00:03.758 --> 00:00:07.030

OK so we are going to be learning. Some new

NOTE Confidence: 0.9158689

00:00:09.336 --> 00:00:12.518
vocabulary that have to do with superstition and I'll explain

NOTE Confidence: 0.9158689

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.770
what superstitions are.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9270724

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.606
We're going to be learning about culture and western culture

NOTE Confidence: 0.9270724

00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:19.210
and North American culture.

NOTE Confidence: 0.929914057

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.612
As well as grammar today, we are going to be

NOTE Confidence: 0.929914057

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.432
learning about the first conditional so this is a great

NOTE Confidence: 0.929914057

00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:26.910
video.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9092337

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.090
Because you are going to be learning a lot by

NOTE Confidence: 0.9092337

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.400
the end of it, hopefully so let's get started.

NOTE Confidence: 0.93929714

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.420
First, I want to tell you about superstitions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.94792527

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.796
I love the topic of superstitions. I think it's very

NOTE Confidence: 0.94792527

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:41.740
interesting.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8400202

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.930
So what is superstition is is it is a belief?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8448949

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.490
And this belief.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8730543

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.500
It's usually cultural.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8603808

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.970
But it can also be personal OK and this belief.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9214516

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.060
Is not based in science so it's not scientific?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9376072

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.804
I'm often times when we're talking about superstitions were talking

NOTE Confidence: 0.9376072

00:01:04.873 --> 00:01:09.300
about supernatural things were talking about good luck bad luck.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8927132

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.750
Curses you know, we're talking about things, maybe from our

NOTE Confidence: 0.8927132

00:01:13.825 --> 00:01:18.190
culture's history and a different way of seeing the world.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9212993

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.994
So if you're confused about superstitions don't worry when I

NOTE Confidence: 0.9212993

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.050
give you examples, you will start to really understand.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8360025

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.270
What is superstition is?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8972246

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.038
OK so let's start off with the an example. Imagine

NOTE Confidence: 0.8972246

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.570
this, I took a test and I did really well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9135929

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.470
I got a very high score on my test.

NOTE Confidence: 0.916707635

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.310
Now, why did I get a high score?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8999545

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.180
Maybe you think oh you probably studied well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8761716

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.089
OK, so that might be kind of a scientific explanation.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8761716

00:01:48.154 --> 00:01:50.810
Om I studied so she did well on her test.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8999791

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.202
Well, maybe I brought a pen to the test and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8999791

00:01:55.284 --> 00:01:58.378
it 's a very lucky pen or a very lucky

NOTE Confidence: 0.8999791

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.030
pencil.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9111295

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.828
And I think anytime I use this pen or pencil.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9111295

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.803
I'm going to do well. It's my lucky charm. It's

NOTE Confidence: 0.9111295

00:02:04.865 --> 00:02:06.290
my lucky pen or pencil.

NOTE Confidence: 0.917515635

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.343
If you think I did well on my test because

NOTE Confidence: 0.917515635

00:02:09.403 --> 00:02:10.540
I have a lucky pen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.941336155

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.180
Then that would be an example of?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8550113

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.730
A superstition.

NOTE Confidence: 0.883843362

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.682
It's like a ritual you do to get good luck

NOTE Confidence: 0.883843362

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.235
or to keep bad luck from happening and it 's

NOTE Confidence: 0.883843362

00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:22.390
a belief about these types of things.

NOTE Confidence: 0.878315449

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.328
OK, so if for example, I say I did great

NOTE Confidence: 0.878315449

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.680
on my test.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8965186

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.773
Because I brought a lucky pen to Class I did

NOTE Confidence: 0.8965186

00:02:32.854 --> 00:02:36.660
really well on my test because it was you know.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8790912

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.086
At 7 PM and 7 is a lucky number, so

NOTE Confidence: 0.8790912

00:02:40.183 --> 00:02:44.770
therefore, you know 7 PM means I'm going to do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.882621169

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.810
Well, on my test.

NOTE Confidence: 0.862000942

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.885
And I were green and Green's a lucky color so

NOTE Confidence: 0.862000942

00:02:48.945 --> 00:02:51.410
all of these reasons. Help me on my test.

NOTE Confidence: 0.940144539

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.760
You would say I'm superstitious.

NOTE Confidence: 0.902607858

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.918
OK, so superstition is a belief it 's a cultural

NOTE Confidence: 0.902607858

00:02:58.993 --> 00:03:02.310
belief that explains something in the world.

NOTE Confidence: 0.785050333

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.040
But not based in science.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9168113

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.360
A person is superstitious we use superstitious to describe people.

NOTE Confidence: 0.945413232

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.638
My mother is the most superstitious person, I know she

NOTE Confidence: 0.945413232

00:03:17.743 --> 00:03:20.060
is very superstitious.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9067502

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.790
Um in our house there are many superstitions OK and

NOTE Confidence: 0.9067502

00:03:24.873 --> 00:03:29.600
that's true. I grew up in a very superstitious household.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9178466

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.616
So let's look at some western superstitions. I grew up

NOTE Confidence: 0.9178466

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.880
with these are the ones that were in my own

NOTE Confidence: 0.9178466

00:03:36.954 --> 00:03:37.770
experience.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8499129

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.850
And my own culture.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8704172

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.700
So one example of a superstition.

NOTE Confidence: 0.901713848

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.950
Is if you walk under a ladder?

NOTE Confidence: 0.929762959

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.300
This is very bad luck.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9058829

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.441
OK so when I walk down the street if I

NOTE Confidence: 0.9058829

00:03:52.512 --> 00:03:55.937
see a ladder. I never walk under it, because I'm

NOTE Confidence: 0.9058829

00:03:56.008 --> 00:03:57.720
also very superstitious.

NOTE Confidence: 0.825163245

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.825
Um if you find a penny so a penny is

NOTE Confidence: 0.825163245

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.304
a type of its type of currency or a type

NOTE Confidence: 0.825163245

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.510
of it 's a form of money.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85698384

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.330
It 's a coin and if you find a penny?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8931059

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.699
I if I ever find a penny. I always pick

NOTE Confidence: 0.8931059

00:04:13.772 --> 00:04:16.788
it up pick it up off the ground because I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8931059

00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:19.730
think the penny will give me good luck.

NOTE Confidence: 0.916870654

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.437
And a little crazy, I know, but a lot of

NOTE Confidence: 0.916870654

00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:24.390
people in North America do this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80939

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.950
Um 13.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9376184

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.420
Is considered a very unlucky number?

NOTE Confidence: 0.936445355

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.671
And Western culture, you'll notice a lot of apartment buildings,

NOTE Confidence: 0.936445355

00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:39.219
do not have a 13th floor and that's because people

NOTE Confidence: 0.936445355

00:04:39.288 --> 00:04:40.540
think it's so bad.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9354931

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.404
They think it's very unlucky so they don't want to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9354931

00:04:43.461 --> 00:04:46.430
live on the 13th floor because they think they will.

NOTE Confidence: 0.898668647

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.800
You know, I have bad luck.

NOTE Confidence: 0.912162542

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.776
I know in China, the number for is very unlucky

NOTE Confidence: 0.912162542

00:04:51.844 --> 00:04:54.836
and so it's the same thing in China. You you

NOTE Confidence: 0.912162542

00:04:54.904 --> 00:04:58.780
don't see in apartment buildings, you usually don't see a

NOTE Confidence: 0.912162542

00:04:58.848 --> 00:05:01.500
fourth floor because it's very unlucky.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8472187

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.578
Um OK, so we've talked about some good luck in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8472187

00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:09.413
some bad like another superstition that we use a lot

NOTE Confidence: 0.8472187

00:05:09.485 --> 00:05:10.860
in western culture.

NOTE Confidence: 0.942080855

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.167
Is when you have somebody who is maybe going for

NOTE Confidence: 0.942080855

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.330
an interview?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8911002

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.253
Doing a test or a presentation or some kind of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8911002

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.720
performance may be there, singing you know turn audience.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876105964

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.560
We like to say to them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8718898

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.949
Break, a leg again, which seems kind of strange to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8718898

00:05:30.008 --> 00:05:33.300
say that somebody boat before somebody does some sort of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8718898

00:05:33.358 --> 00:05:36.180
presentation or performance. We say break a leg.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8883145

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.891
And that's considered a good luck thing to do like

NOTE Confidence: 0.8883145

00:05:39.953 --> 00:05:42.110
if you say break a leg to somebody.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8902397

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.836
It means you're wishing them. Good luck OK, so break

NOTE Confidence: 0.8902397

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.750
a leg means good luck.

NOTE Confidence: 0.922743559

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.849
I hope you break a leg on your exam today

NOTE Confidence: 0.922743559

00:05:51.915 --> 00:05:54.801
means I hope you have good luck on your exam

NOTE Confidence: 0.922743559

00:05:54.866 --> 00:05:55.260
today.

NOTE Confidence: 0.861557961

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.680
So this is also like superstitions to say this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.091179356

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.640
Um.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9166495

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.769
This one is my mother's favorite thing to say, I

NOTE Confidence: 0.9166495

00:06:02.826 --> 00:06:05.280
think this is the things she says the most.

NOTE Confidence: 0.93631

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.140
And things always happen in threes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8981158

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.917
OK, so if I you know for example, trip and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8981158

00:06:14.023 --> 00:06:14.550
fall.

NOTE Confidence: 0.880564153

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.844
My mom will say OK that's one time you're going

NOTE Confidence: 0.880564153

00:06:17.904 --> 00:06:20.876
to fall again. Maybe 2 more times today, so you'll

NOTE Confidence: 0.880564153

00:06:20.935 --> 00:06:22.600
fall 3 times today in total.

NOTE Confidence: 0.894405544

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.662
And I always think well, she 's a little crazy,

NOTE Confidence: 0.894405544

00:06:25.727 --> 00:06:27.610
but she's very superstitious.

NOTE Confidence: 0.857401848

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.801
OK, or if um if I do well on my

NOTE Confidence: 0.857401848

00:06:30.883 --> 00:06:34.998
test, she'll say, Oh, this is great, you did, well

NOTE Confidence: 0.857401848

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.150
on this test.

NOTE Confidence: 0.878886342

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.500
You have 2 more tests.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9037634

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.430
So you will do well on all 3 tests.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9344815

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.510
Because things always happen in threes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.825580359

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.659
Or you know, even worse if I do bad on

NOTE Confidence: 0.825580359

00:06:46.733 --> 00:06:49.458
a test so say to you did, bad on this

NOTE Confidence: 0.825580359

00:06:49.532 --> 00:06:49.900
test.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9009359

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.644
You're going to do bad on the next 2 because

NOTE Confidence: 0.9009359

00:06:52.697 --> 00:06:54.320
things always happen in threes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9153147

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.066
So that's what I mean, it is not scientific at

NOTE Confidence: 0.9153147

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:01.432
all but you know you have people who are very

NOTE Confidence: 0.9153147

00:07:01.506 --> 00:07:02.530
superstitious.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8408891

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:03.910
Who say These Things?

NOTE Confidence: 0.873735964

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.489
Um another common superstition in the West and maybe you

NOTE Confidence: 0.873735964

00:07:08.557 --> 00:07:11.830
have the same superstition. I don't know is not.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6929756

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.790
On Wood,

NOTE Confidence: 0.6766029

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.230
OK, so.

NOTE Confidence: 0.912043035

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.160
What happens is?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9435967

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.520
If you say something good about the future.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9285494

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.870
You want it to happen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.873235643

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.938
So to keep good luck and to make sure it

NOTE Confidence: 0.873235643

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.050
happens, we

NOTE Confidence: 0.831362069

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.470
OK, this is what?

NOTE Confidence: 0.782794237

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.268
Now it's correct we knock on it, OK, so we

NOTE Confidence: 0.782794237

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:35.810
say knock on wood.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9179544

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.904
So for example, if I say you know what tomorrow

NOTE Confidence: 0.9179544

00:07:39.975 --> 00:07:43.319
I have a test. I studied really hard. I'm going

NOTE Confidence: 0.9179544

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.880
to do amazing on my test I know it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.914212

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.788
I need to knock on word otherwise because I said

NOTE Confidence: 0.914212

00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:51.870
that I'm going to have bad luck.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8630793

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.060
Or you know if so, a lot of people here,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8630793

00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:59.094
you'll see them, knocking on tables on doors on anything

NOTE Confidence: 0.8630793

00:07:59.165 --> 00:07:59.660
wooden.

NOTE Confidence: 0.910538852

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.296
And it's because they want to keep the good luck

NOTE Confidence: 0.910538852

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.140
and they want to prevent bad luck from happening so

NOTE Confidence: 0.910538852

00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:07.000
it 's a very common superstition.

NOTE Confidence: 0.416928649

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:09.790
OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9208079

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.652
So again these are all examples of superstitions in western

NOTE Confidence: 0.9208079

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.960
culture. You know, and then we also have our own

NOTE Confidence: 0.9208079

00:08:18.027 --> 00:08:20.660
personal superstitions, so for example.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87419945

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.811
I have an a lucky necklace that I like to

NOTE Confidence: 0.87419945

00:08:23.887 --> 00:08:28.177
wear you know during exams are tests. You know different

NOTE Confidence: 0.87419945

00:08:28.254 --> 00:08:32.007
people like I said, before maybe you have a lucky

NOTE Confidence: 0.87419945

00:08:32.084 --> 00:08:32.390
pen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85000366

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.780
Or, a lucky shirt.

NOTE Confidence: 0.91498965

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.437
I know for a sports a lot of people will

NOTE Confidence: 0.91498965

00:08:37.514 --> 00:08:39.140
always wear the same.

NOTE Confidence: 0.92315805

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.196
Like Jersey or shirt because they think that if they

NOTE Confidence: 0.92315805

00:08:43.266 --> 00:08:46.739
wear that Jersey their team will win OK, so these

NOTE Confidence: 0.92315805

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.220
are all examples of superstitions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.903329849

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.560
And there are thousands of them OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9180213

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.327
So now let's look at the grammar of superstitions, OK,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9180213

00:08:56.386 --> 00:09:00.187
so we've talked about the culture. We've talked about vocabulary

NOTE Confidence: 0.9180213

00:09:00.247 --> 00:09:01.850
superstition superstitious.

NOTE Confidence: 0.93394053

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.799
Now we're going to talk about grammar and specifically the

NOTE Confidence: 0.93394053

00:09:05.867 --> 00:09:07.090
first conditional.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9254233

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.930
OK, so now we're going to learn about the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.9254233

00:09:10.986 --> 00:09:11.660
conditional.

NOTE Confidence: 0.921435535

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:16.023
There are more than one conditional there's the first conditional

NOTE Confidence: 0.921435535

00:09:16.085 --> 00:09:19.630
the second conditional the third conditional and so forth.

NOTE Confidence: 0.930762

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.880
Today we are only focused on the first one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915174365

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.122
And this is a very important piece of grammar in

NOTE Confidence: 0.915174365

00:09:26.178 --> 00:09:29.140
English. We use the first conditional all the time so

NOTE Confidence: 0.915174365

00:09:29.196 --> 00:09:31.040
it's something you want to learn.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9037221

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.803
OK So what is the first conditional? Well, I have

NOTE Confidence: 0.9037221

00:09:34.873 --> 00:09:38.137
here an example of a sentence that is the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.9037221

00:09:38.207 --> 00:09:39.040
conditional?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9257008

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.060
If I study for my test.

NOTE Confidence: 0.877988636

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.080
Comma I will pass it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.284638464

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:46.010
OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.937486768

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.129
And then I have another example if you break a

NOTE Confidence: 0.937486768

00:09:50.211 --> 00:09:53.570
mirror you will have 7 years of bad luck.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8725386

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.358
So these 2 sentence is have the same grammar, they're

NOTE Confidence: 0.8725386

00:09:57.419 --> 00:09:59.410
both first conditional sentences.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8874253

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:04.006
So what first conditional sentences are are they are sentence

NOTE Confidence: 0.8874253

00:10:04.072 --> 00:10:06.010
is that have 2 parts to them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9076931

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:13.070
And what they reflect is a cause and effect relationship.

NOTE Confidence: 0.891690969

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.650
So what do I mean by that well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.914527535

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.151
If I study for my test so that's the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.914527535

00:10:19.226 --> 00:10:19.600
part.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9413085

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.700
What is going to happen?

NOTE Confidence: 0.904218435

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:23.740
This is the cause.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9123854

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.242
OK, I study for my test and then we have

NOTE Confidence: 0.9123854

00:10:27.305 --> 00:10:30.557
the second part which is the effect which means what

NOTE Confidence: 0.9123854

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.120
happens.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90545094

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.304
If I study for my test, I will pass my

NOTE Confidence: 0.90545094

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.800
test, I will do well on my test.

NOTE Confidence: 0.856619656

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.963
So this is the affect OK, so first conditionals, you

NOTE Confidence: 0.856619656

00:10:41.034 --> 00:10:42.470
always have 2 parts.

NOTE Confidence: 0.867191136

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.460
You have the cause.

NOTE Confidence: 0.894388855

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:46.810
And then you have the effect.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9110226

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.650
In this case, we have our cause.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9123407

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.669
If you break a mirror OK, so this is the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9123407

00:10:53.733 --> 00:10:56.410
cause. What happens if you break a mirror.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9215649

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.810
Well, if you're a superstitious person like my mom.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8276801

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.720
If you break a mirror what happens.

NOTE Confidence: 0.910151

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.444
You will have 7 years of bad luck, OK for

NOTE Confidence: 0.910151

00:11:07.522 --> 00:11:11.050
other people. Maybe if there more scientific.

NOTE Confidence: 0.898622453

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.255
Maybe this would be if you break a mirror you

NOTE Confidence: 0.898622453

00:11:14.318 --> 00:11:16.864
will have to buy a new one OK, so that's

NOTE Confidence: 0.898622453

00:11:16.928 --> 00:11:17.310
cause.

NOTE Confidence: 0.588575363

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.210
Affect.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82016474

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.940
So always in 2 parts.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8935812

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.140
So the thing about the first conditional is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9469826

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.638
We're talking about a cause and effect. But it's not

NOTE Confidence: 0.9469826

00:11:28.713 --> 00:11:31.750
100% that the effect is going to happen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9212354

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.808
So what do I mean by that well if I

NOTE Confidence: 0.9212354

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.180
study for my test?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8622899

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:37.930
I will pass it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.890450358

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.390
This part is in the future.

NOTE Confidence: 0.929496646

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.670
And so we don't know the future.

NOTE Confidence: 0.924096

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.284
I don't know if I'm going to pass the test

NOTE Confidence: 0.924096

00:11:45.339 --> 00:11:45.940
if I study.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9228885

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.141
But I'm pretty sure OK. I'm not 100% sure maybe

NOTE Confidence: 0.9228885

00:11:50.222 --> 00:11:53.862
there is a you know a trick question or maybe

NOTE Confidence: 0.9228885

00:11:53.942 --> 00:11:55.560
the day of the test.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9004598

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.843
You know, I didn't sleep well so I don't remember

NOTE Confidence: 0.9004598

00:11:58.909 --> 00:12:02.182
any of the answers. Or maybe you know, my teacher

NOTE Confidence: 0.9004598

00:12:02.249 --> 00:12:04.920
makes a mistake while they mark my test.

NOTE Confidence: 0.965892255

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:09.590
So even though I'm not sure 100%.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8713417

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.130
That you know if I study I will do well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9403439

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.950
I'm pretty sure.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915253043

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.858
I'm probably it 's a probability so it probably will

NOTE Confidence: 0.915253043

00:12:18.926 --> 00:12:22.056
happen. And so this is very key with the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.915253043

00:12:22.124 --> 00:12:22.940
conditional.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9422983

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.310
You're talking about things.

NOTE Confidence: 0.932922244

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:28.970
In the future that are very likely to happen, OK,

NOTE Confidence: 0.932922244

00:12:29.059 --> 00:12:31.880
maybe like 90% likely to happen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7868085

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.779
OK, so let now let's breakdown the grammar of this

NOTE Confidence: 0.7868085

00:12:36.864 --> 00:12:37.120
OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9089615

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:41.162
If I study for my test comma, I will pass

NOTE Confidence: 0.9089615

00:12:41.251 --> 00:12:41.520
it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9410961

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.407
So I've already said this but just to see if

NOTE Confidence: 0.9410961

00:12:44.462 --> 00:12:47.354
you were listening. How many parts are there in this

NOTE Confidence: 0.9410961

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:47.910
sentence?

NOTE Confidence: 0.881862

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:53.681
If you said 2 you are correct, we have the

NOTE Confidence: 0.881862

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.510
cause.

NOTE Confidence: 0.912731647

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:59.550
And then after the comma, we have the effect.

NOTE Confidence: 0.907600164

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:02.442
OK, so now, what I want you to do is

NOTE Confidence: 0.907600164

00:13:02.513 --> 00:13:05.300
I want you to look at the first word in

NOTE Confidence: 0.907600164

00:13:05.371 --> 00:13:06.300
the sentence.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9264388

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.170
What is the first word?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7179787

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.670
If you said if.

NOTE Confidence: 0.931679964

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.160
You are correct.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83557117

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.736
When we use the first conditional we, we usually have

NOTE Confidence: 0.83557117

00:13:15.798 --> 00:13:17.825
the word if in it, OK, so if is a

NOTE Confidence: 0.83557117

00:13:17.887 --> 00:13:19.730
part of the first conditional.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7992029

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.570
I'm sorry have it down here if.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8492005

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.050
And then what comes after if.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8265679

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.650
We have a subject.

NOTE Confidence: 0.801577866

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:31.747
In my BI it could be you, it could be,

NOTE Confidence: 0.801577866

00:13:31.863 --> 00:13:36.240
he she we they it can be any of those.

NOTE Confidence: 0.860404968

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.980
After the subject we have a verb.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8354626

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.200
If I study for if you break OK, so the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8354626

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:45.520
green underline these are all verbs.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8444642

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.097
And if you look at the tense of the verb

NOTE Confidence: 0.8444642

00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:50.440
what tense is it in.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87554884

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:55.393
If I study this is the present tense, OK if

NOTE Confidence: 0.87554884

00:13:55.483 --> 00:13:57.280
I study for my test.

NOTE Confidence: 0.758787155

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.140
I will pass it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8083621

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.613
OK so then so we have your if plus subject

NOTE Confidence: 0.8083621

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.131
is kind of like math if you don't like math

NOTE Confidence: 0.8083621

00:14:05.188 --> 00:14:05.760
that's OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.862409234

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.948
Will see some more examples of you know that might

NOTE Confidence: 0.862409234

00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:12.316
make this easier. But if plus subject plus verb plus

NOTE Confidence: 0.862409234

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.350
objects the objects are in red.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9022885

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.027
Then we have a comma very important this piece of

NOTE Confidence: 0.9022885

00:14:19.102 --> 00:14:20.000
punctuation.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8437552

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.130
I so we have another subject.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7373042

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:24.420
Will.

NOTE Confidence: 0.67111665

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.690
Has it?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8209286

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.197
So the first conditional always has the word it will

NOTE Confidence: 0.8209286

00:14:30.254 --> 00:14:32.430
in it, too, it always has the word if.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8748332

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.664
And it also always has the word will or won't

NOTE Confidence: 0.8748332

00:14:35.726 --> 00:14:39.340
if you're talking about like the negative version of will.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6518698

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.790
OK, so.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9280711

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.230
This is the formula of the first conditional.

NOTE Confidence: 0.914363444

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.329
OK, you are going to get to practice this in

NOTE Confidence: 0.914363444

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:50.830
a moment I'm going to give you some words.

NOTE Confidence: 0.921052

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.138
And you are going to make your own first conditional

NOTE Confidence: 0.921052

00:14:53.182 --> 00:14:53.580
sentence.

NOTE Confidence: 0.845892251

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:58.180
Following this formula it came following my example.

NOTE Confidence: 0.849812

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.080
So again one last time I'll say this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8130591

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.130
After the comma.

NOTE Confidence: 0.802881539

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.890
So after the cause.

NOTE Confidence: 0.867302954

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.610
We have the effect.

NOTE Confidence: 0.828107357

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:10.260
And it's be affect that has the word willing it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9241732

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:14.242
Because we are talking about something in the future OK,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9241732

00:15:14.306 --> 00:15:16.370
so the causes and the president.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9005873

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.100
And the effect or the second part of the sentence.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8779821

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.850
We use the future tense.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8747069

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.287
So now let's do some actually before we get to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8747069

00:15:25.351 --> 00:15:28.308
some practice. I just wanted to ask you if you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8747069

00:15:28.372 --> 00:15:31.200
have this same superstition in your culture.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8982134

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.072
If you break a mirror you will have 7 years

NOTE Confidence: 0.8982134

00:15:34.131 --> 00:15:34.840
of bad luck.

NOTE Confidence: 0.871785164

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:38.019
I wonder because I actually did this, I when I

NOTE Confidence: 0.871785164

00:15:38.076 --> 00:15:40.380
was 7 II stepped on a mirror and I broke

NOTE Confidence: 0.871785164

00:15:40.437 --> 00:15:40.610
it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8895567

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.892
And I was so worried about having bad luck for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8895567

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:45.412
7 years, but you know, my life actually went quite

NOTE Confidence: 0.8895567

00:15:45.461 --> 00:15:46.400
quite good at that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.846106

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:49.245
Period of life so you know just wondering if your

NOTE Confidence: 0.846106

00:15:49.303 --> 00:15:52.600
culture has something similar to when you break a mirror.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8861864

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:53.380
What happens?

NOTE Confidence: 0.923248768

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:57.002
Alright so now let's look at some examples, some more

NOTE Confidence: 0.923248768

00:15:57.054 --> 00:15:59.755
examples of the first conditional. I want you to get

NOTE Confidence: 0.923248768

00:15:59.807 --> 00:16:02.040
out of pen and a piece of paper because you

NOTE Confidence: 0.923248768

00:16:02.092 --> 00:16:03.650
are going to do some work now.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8926902

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.730
OK so we've looked at the first conditional.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9052203

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:09.652
And we looked at a couple of examples. Now I'm

NOTE Confidence: 0.9052203

00:16:09.707 --> 00:16:11.917
going to get you to try to do a sentence

NOTE Confidence: 0.9052203

00:16:11.973 --> 00:16:12.470
or cells?

NOTE Confidence: 0.907406

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.348
And if you have trouble that's OK, you know this

NOTE Confidence: 0.907406

00:16:15.398 --> 00:16:18.034
is the first time you're probably doing this so don't

NOTE Confidence: 0.907406

00:16:18.084 --> 00:16:18.830
worry about it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.906561136

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.390
But I do want you to try.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8559864

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:24.720
So I have here a western superstition.

NOTE Confidence: 0.78641206

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.190
If you find a penny out of also there's not

NOTE Confidence: 0.78641206

00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:30.630
enough first conditional find a penny.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8579904

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.390
This equals good luck.

NOTE Confidence: 0.917396367

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.226
OK, so how can we make this into a first

NOTE Confidence: 0.917396367

00:16:36.284 --> 00:16:37.500
conditional sentence?

NOTE Confidence: 0.929433644

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.740
And to help you I've left the mathematical formula on

NOTE Confidence: 0.929433644

00:16:41.809 --> 00:16:42.500
the board.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9059104

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:44.640
So we have the different things you need.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637875

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:50.010
OK, in order to turn this into a first conditional

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637875

00:16:50.097 --> 00:16:50.880
sentence.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9293835

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.807
So I want you to pause. The video stop the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9293835

00:16:53.876 --> 00:16:57.210
video on a piece of paper try it yourself first.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8961067

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.506
And then turn on the video and I will explain

NOTE Confidence: 0.8961067

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:04.020
how we turn this into a first conditional sentence OK,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8961067

00:17:04.084 --> 00:17:05.490
so positive video now.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8934455

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.954
OK, so welcome back so now we are going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8934455

00:17:10.021 --> 00:17:13.706
turn this into a first conditional sentence. I want you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8934455

00:17:13.773 --> 00:17:15.850
to see if this is what you got.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8673338

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.610
So first conditional we start with F.

NOTE Confidence: 0.794246554

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.810
OK so we look down here if.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7509578

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.000
So start with F.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8748127

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.190
Now we need a subject.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8853553

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.300
In this case, we can, we can use any subject.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8639033

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:32.370
But the subject I'm going to use is you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.831620455

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.580
So if you

NOTE Confidence: 0.871076167

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.940
So we have our subject.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8633204

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.144
Now we need a verb if you OK well, we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8633204

00:17:40.213 --> 00:17:41.850
have a very bright here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87278384

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.580
If you find?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6627168

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:47.300
A penny.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5854485

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:51.970
OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.746410966

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.890
Then Penny is our object.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9099577

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.343
What do we need next most important thing people always

NOTE Confidence: 0.9099577

00:17:58.398 --> 00:17:58.780
forget?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8325984

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.220
Comma that's right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8946572

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.590
So if you find a penny?

NOTE Confidence: 0.912956238

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:06.520
What happens?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8784159

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.450
In western superstitions what happens if you find a penny?

NOTE Confidence: 0.866133869

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.560
So now we need another subject so we will use

NOTE Confidence: 0.866133869

00:18:13.612 --> 00:18:14.130
you again.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8597313

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.260
And then what do we need will?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7854231

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.040
And then

NOTE Confidence: 0.833892

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.278
Our verb so in this case you know you get

NOTE Confidence: 0.833892

00:18:25.347 --> 00:18:27.570
good luck or you have good luck.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8294997

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.320
So if you find a penny you well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.64900285

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.390
Have.

NOTE Confidence: 0.870816

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.390
Good luck and good luck is our object.

NOTE Confidence: 0.4924289

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.260
Period.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8704116

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.258
Great so compare your sentence even if you didn't get

NOTE Confidence: 0.8704116

00:18:43.325 --> 00:18:46.970
everything the same did you get some things, the same.

NOTE Confidence: 0.877078235

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.814
Because you should be really proud of yourself if you

NOTE Confidence: 0.877078235

00:18:49.868 --> 00:18:52.060
did, if you got if at the beginning. Yay.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8605881

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:54.448
Give yourself a round of applause or if you you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8605881

00:18:54.499 --> 00:18:56.320
know if you got any of this, if you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897597253

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.370
Remember, the comma that's amazing a lot of people don't.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8964639

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:05.148
So let's try with another example OK. I have here

NOTE Confidence: 0.8964639

00:19:05.252 --> 00:19:10.630
another superstition if you open an umbrella inside.

NOTE Confidence: 0.920927

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:12.390
What happens?

NOTE Confidence: 0.825555742

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:17.790
NR superstition you will have bad luck OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915316164

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.312
So now, what I want to do is stop the

NOTE Confidence: 0.915316164

00:19:20.369 --> 00:19:22.620
video and try to make your own sentence.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8940356

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:27.876
About this superstition and this formula again can help you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8940356

00:19:27.953 --> 00:19:30.620
with that OK so stop the video now.

NOTE Confidence: 0.910084367

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.620
And then we will continue.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8800289

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:36.310
OK, welcome back again.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8962587

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.860
Now let's make this into a first conditional sentence.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9146019

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.270
So what do we need to start with?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9057452

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.010
You said if you are correct.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8763498

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.660
And then again, we need a subject if.

NOTE Confidence: 0.672574162

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.290
You.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8445895

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.190
And we need a verb.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8810446

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.280
And the verb is in the present tense.

NOTE Confidence: 0.831880569

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.570
If you open.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87511307

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.970
An umbrella.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8365888

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.430
Inside.

NOTE Confidence: 0.884200931

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.980
OK, so we have the first part and is this

NOTE Confidence: 0.884200931

00:20:10.035 --> 00:20:11.370
the cause or the effect.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8936364

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:16.975
This is the cause so the causes. What causes something

NOTE Confidence: 0.8936364

00:20:17.063 --> 00:20:21.000
to happen. So if you open an umbrella inside.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900033534

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:21.750
What happens?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7957564

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.030
Well, we put the comma.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8961881

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.340
And again a lot of students forget this comma very

NOTE Confidence: 0.8961881

00:20:28.402 --> 00:20:29.020
important.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8542538

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.501
' Cause it separates the cause and the effect so

NOTE Confidence: 0.8542538

00:20:32.553 --> 00:20:34.860
we have the comma and now we need the effect.

NOTE Confidence: 0.879921436

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.020
What do we put if you open an umbrella inside?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6866558

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:39.970
You.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7919923

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.540
Will again will is always with the first conditional?

NOTE Confidence: 0.39460063

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:45.880
Path.

NOTE Confidence: 0.44341898

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.380
Bad.

NOTE Confidence: 0.496784627

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:50.150
Lock.

NOTE Confidence: 0.472526938

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:54.260
OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900300443

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:58.806
Great so compare your answer? Did you get something similar?

NOTE Confidence: 0.900300443

00:20:58.875 --> 00:21:01.992
Maybe you forgot a word. It's OK this takes a

NOTE Confidence: 0.900300443

00:21:02.062 --> 00:21:03.170
lot of practice?

NOTE Confidence: 0.886221468

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:05.062
And we do have a quiz at the end, that

NOTE Confidence: 0.886221468

00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:07.735
you can do more practice on to really get comfortable

NOTE Confidence: 0.886221468

00:21:07.785 --> 00:21:08.280
with this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8429698

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:11.714
Byram you know this is you should have something similar

NOTE Confidence: 0.8429698

00:21:11.768 --> 00:21:12.200
to this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8464007

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:17.779
Um OK great, so we use the first conditional a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8464007

00:21:17.874 --> 00:21:18.250
lot.

NOTE Confidence: 0.885913432

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.300
Um one more thing I wanted to say about it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.3134952

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:22.300
is?

NOTE Confidence: 0.920386

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:26.020
Can you switch the cause and effect in the sentence?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9287642

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.307
So for example, here I have a few open an

NOTE Confidence: 0.9287642

00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:31.880
umbrella inside you will have bad luck.

NOTE Confidence: 0.924193144

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.058
Can I say you will have bad luck if you

NOTE Confidence: 0.924193144

00:21:35.129 --> 00:21:38.690
open an umbrella inside? Can I switch part one and

NOTE Confidence: 0.924193144

00:21:38.761 --> 00:21:39.260
part 2?

NOTE Confidence: 0.894602239

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:42.600
You can OK so that would look like.

NOTE Confidence: 0.08658865

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.210
Um.

NOTE Confidence: 0.869783163

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.622
That would look like so imagine if I get rid

NOTE Confidence: 0.869783163

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:48.230
of this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8884882

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:53.005
I turn this into a capital letter so you will

NOTE Confidence: 0.8884882

00:21:53.085 --> 00:21:54.290
have good luck.

NOTE Confidence: 0.843178451

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.470
Get rid of the period.

NOTE Confidence: 0.265837133

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:58.380
If.

NOTE Confidence: 0.648006439

00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.590
You.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7066231

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.520
Find.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6163495

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.240
A penny.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900490463

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.670
So they have the same meaning.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86289686

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.929
Um you have a choice with with the way you

NOTE Confidence: 0.86289686

00:22:12.991 --> 00:22:15.848
do it do what feels comfortable for you, OK if

NOTE Confidence: 0.86289686

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.270
one of these is easier than the other.

NOTE Confidence: 0.901091635

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.033
You know, do whatever is easiest for you, you'll also

NOTE Confidence: 0.901091635

00:22:21.085 --> 00:22:23.630
notice when I switch it around you will have good

NOTE Confidence: 0.901091635

00:22:23.682 --> 00:22:24.980
luck if you find a penny?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9162009

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:26.970
There is no comma.

NOTE Confidence: 0.904780567

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.789
OK, so when if is at the beginning of the

NOTE Confidence: 0.904780567

00:22:30.874 --> 00:22:31.640
sentence.

NOTE Confidence: 0.875582635

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.420
You need a comma here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9212321

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.421
If if is in the middle of the sentence. You

NOTE Confidence: 0.9212321

00:22:38.504 --> 00:22:40.160
do not need a comma.

NOTE Confidence: 0.882527947

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.599
OK and again this is a lot of material. You've

NOTE Confidence: 0.882527947

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.554
just learned about vocabulary. You learned about culture and now

NOTE Confidence: 0.882527947

00:22:47.615 --> 00:22:49.440
you're learning about grammar.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9217616

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.939
So you might want to watch this video, a couple

NOTE Confidence: 0.9217616

00:22:51.992 --> 00:22:54.270
of times, just to practice and get used to.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8749516

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.588
You know the vocabulary and grammar, ik specially it will

NOTE Confidence: 0.8749516

00:22:57.646 --> 00:23:00.200
help you to watch this video multiple times.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9366572

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.854

NOTE Confidence: 0.9366572

00:23:07.275 --> 00:23:07.920

NOTE Confidence: 0.8703778

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:11.674
Where you can practice conditionals and you can practice the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8703778

00:23:11.737 --> 00:23:14.670
ordering and you know like where do you put if?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9273378

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.689
Where do you put will what does this mean OK

NOTE Confidence: 0.9273378

00:23:17.757 --> 00:23:20.903
so we will have a lot of questions about that?
