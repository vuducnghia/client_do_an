00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.275
Hello my name is Emma, an in today's video I 

2
00:00:03.349 --> 00:00:06.550
 am going to teach you some key expressions. 

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.075
 You can use when somebody tells you something that's not 

4
00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:15.600
 true and you want to argue against what they're saying. 

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.983
 So, in this video I'm going to teach you these 

6
00:00:19.056 --> 00:00:20.380
 great expressions. 

7
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.970
 But before I do that. 

8
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.431
 We're going to talk about 3 words that are very 

9
00:00:25.505 --> 00:00:26.830
 common in English. 

10
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.363
 These days, those 3 words are fake news conspiracy theories 

11
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.743
 and hoax is so in this video you will learn 

12
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.510
 what these words mean? 

13
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.964
 And you will also learn what to say to somebody 

14
00:00:40.037 --> 00:00:43.050
 that tells you something that's not true. 

15
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.390
 Alright so let's get started. 

16
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.017
 So I have here 3 sentence is the first sentence 

17
00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:53.660
 is scientists say the Earth is flat, 

18
00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.090
 not round. Is this true or not true? 

19
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.490
 OK, this sentence is not true some people believe this 

20
00:01:04.572 --> 00:01:06.120
 but it is not true. 

21
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.367
 My second sentence Michael Jackson is alive and living as 

22
00:01:12.476 --> 00:01:14.120
 Kim Kardashian. 

23
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.370
 True or not true. 

24
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.860
 Again, we have a sentence that is not true I 

25
00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:20.970
 made this up. 

26
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.990
 And finally my third sentence listening to rock music causes 

27
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.100
 cancer is this true or untrue. 

28
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.841
 Again, this is untrue. I also made up this so 

29
00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:37.166
 my point here is that a lot of what you 

30
00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:40.990
 hear from people in conversation is not true. 

31
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.260
 People say, these types of things all the time and 

32
00:01:44.325 --> 00:01:47.726
 you will know that this is something that's not true 

33
00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:50.800
 So what do you say when someone tells you that 

34
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.883
 the earth is flat or they tell you that Michael 

35
00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:56.310
 Jackson is living as Kim Kardashian, 

36
00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.244
 so I will teach you those great expressions you can 

37
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:00.630
 use. 

38
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.616
 Before I do that I wanted to just say that 

39
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:09.740
 these 3 sentence is can also be considered fake news. 

40
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.566
 So we will look at the meaning of fake news 

41
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:13.420
 in a moment. 

42
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.380
 OK so the 3 main words, 

43
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.171
 I wanted to teach you today are words that you 

44
00:02:19.254 --> 00:02:22.633
 will see a lot on the Internet and in the 

45
00:02:22.715 --> 00:02:23.210
 media. 

46
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.017
 The first word is fake news So what is fake 

47
00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:29.850
 news while fake means not true? 

48
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.161
 Fake news is news stories that are not true and 

49
00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:37.280
 their created to damage a person, 

50
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.218
 a business. An agency or government or they might also 

51
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.700
 be created to get attention and to get clicks on 

52
00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:47.980
 the Internet. 

53
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.111
 So you'll see a lot of fake news on different 

54
00:02:52.203 --> 00:02:54.590
 social media like Twitter, 

55
00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.250
 Facebook and a lot of other places to online. 

56
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.670
 So this is very common word these days a lot 

57
00:03:02.725 --> 00:03:03.990
 of people are using it. 

58
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.250
 So it's important that you know what it means. 

59
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.280
 We also have the word here, 

60
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.600
 conspiracy theory. So a conspiracy theory. 

61
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.151
 Is an explanation? Of an event or situation that is 

62
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.952
 different from the official account alot of the Times conspiracy 

63
00:03:25.041 --> 00:03:31.020
 theories are about government or a business doing something illegal 

64
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.371
 or to harm someone so let's think of some conspiracy 

65
00:03:36.474 --> 00:03:37.400
 theories. 

66
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.050
 Some people believe that the moon landing. 

67
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.115
 So when when astronauts went to the moon in the 

68
00:03:45.201 --> 00:03:45.720
 1960s. 

69
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.200
 Some people believe the moon landing was fake. 

70
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.500
 This is a popular conspiracy theory. 

71
00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.380
 Another conspiracy theory, I heard recently is some people believe 

72
00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:06.636
 that Paul McCartney from The Beatles actually died in 1966 

73
00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:11.090
 and there is a different man who replaced him and 

74
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.840
 who is actually the better musician so this is a 

75
00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.710
 different conspiracy theory. 

76
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.364
 So you'll see a lot of conspiracy theories on the 

77
00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:23.110
 Internet. 

78
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.410
 And a lot of people will tell you conspiracy theories 

79
00:04:26.472 --> 00:04:27.780
 during conversations. 

80
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.618
 The last word I wanted to teach you was the 

81
00:04:31.707 --> 00:04:32.600
 word hoax. 

82
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.291
 Hoax so a hoax. Is a type of practical joke 

83
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.746
 that is meant to embarrass or hurt people so some 

84
00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:44.710
 examples of hoax? 

85
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.938
 Is our you'll have these death hoax is where they'll 

86
00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:50.970
 say a celebrity is dead, 

87
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.443
 but it's not true, it's a joke or you might 

88
00:04:54.524 --> 00:04:58.482
 have a hoax like some people might take a picture 

89
00:04:58.563 --> 00:05:02.440
 of an alien or a monster and tell everyone look. 

90
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.890
 We have evidence of this monster or alien, 

91
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.000
 but if it's not true then it's. 

92
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.960
 It's a joke of practical joke. 

93
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.576
 So again fake news conspiracy theories an hoax is are 

94
00:05:15.644 --> 00:05:19.124
 very common on the Internet and so for these things 

95
00:05:19.192 --> 00:05:20.420
 that are not true? 

96
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.774
 What do you say to people when they tell you 

97
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.680
 this untrue information? 

98
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.840
 Well let's find out in a moment. 

99
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.506
 OK, so you've heard a fake news story or conspiracy 

100
00:05:31.578 --> 00:05:32.800
 theory or a hoax. 

101
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.160
 Maybe your aunt or your friend just told you it 

102
00:05:36.231 --> 00:05:39.091
 an you know it's not true So what do you 

103
00:05:39.162 --> 00:05:40.020
 say to them? 

104
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.910
 Well, what you can do is you can challenge their 

105
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:44.720
 argument? 

106
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.920
 So for example, you can say. 

107
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.350
 So let me get this straight you're saying and you 

108
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.240
 can repeat what they said. 

109
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.680
 So let me get this straight you're saying Paul McCartney 

110
00:05:58.777 --> 00:06:00.040
 died in 1966. 

111
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.440
 And then what you can say is. 

112
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.640
 And say that's not true. 

113
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.870
 That's inaccurate. I find that hard to believe. 

114
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.630
 That doesn't make sense. So these are all expressions, 

115
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.400
 we use when we're saying I don't believe you. 

116
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.632
 Now, if we wanted to say something that was a 

117
00:06:22.704 --> 00:06:24.500
 little bit more impolite. 

118
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.800
 We can use the word BS as in that's BS. 

119
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.417
 BS stands for bullshit an sometimes we don't want to 

120
00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:36.768
 swear so we might just say to our friends that's 

121
00:06:36.857 --> 00:06:38.810
 total BS or that's BS. 

122
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.710
 You can also say to somebody that's ridiculous, 

123
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.010
 meaning that's that's a stupid story. 

124
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.850
 That's ridiculous it's not true. 

125
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.550
 So these are all examples of common things. 

126
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.589
 People say when someone tells them something that they don't 

127
00:06:53.656 --> 00:06:56.954
 believe so now let's look at some other things we 

128
00:06:57.022 --> 00:07:00.320
 can say when somebody tells us a fake news story. 

129
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.165
 OK, so another thing you can do when somebody tells 

130
00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:05.955
 you fake news or something that's not true is you 

131
00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:08.800
 can ask them where their sources or where did they 

132
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.246
 get the information from? So this is the big where 

133
00:07:13.335 --> 00:07:18.225
 question when we talk about sources or new sources were 

134
00:07:18.314 --> 00:07:21.960
 talking about who said it so for example, 

135
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.630
 maybe the news came from your mom. 

136
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.170
 So maybe that's not a great source. 

137
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.220
 Maybe it came from BBC News. 

138
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.563
 Or maybe it came from wika pedia or Facebook or 

139
00:07:33.634 --> 00:07:36.764
 if you're in science is maybe it came from a 

140
00:07:36.835 --> 00:07:38.400
 peer reviewed Journal. 

141
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.756
 Maybe it came from Twitter or your aunt or your 

142
00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:44.470
 friends so it's good to ask somebody. 

143
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.030
 Where did they get the information from? 

144
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:52.327
 And then you can think about OK is that a 

145
00:07:52.432 --> 00:07:53.690
 good source. 

146
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.780
 And a lot of the times it probably isn't. 

147
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.280
 And you can tell them this OK, 

148
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.350
 so if somebody tells you for example, 

149
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:06.657
 that the moon landing didn't happen and there's a big 

150
00:08:06.738 --> 00:08:11.370
 conspiracy and aliens control the US and Canada and China 

151
00:08:11.451 --> 00:08:14.620
 but you can say to them is who told you 

152
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.570
 that? Where is your news source and if they say, 

153
00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.674
 Oh, my friend Gary told me that well then you 

154
00:08:22.765 --> 00:08:26.230
 can say that's not a good news source. 

155
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:31.894
 You can also ask them why or how questions so 

156
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.530
 for example, 

157
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:37.830
 you know why would. You know. 

158
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:42.237
 Let's start with how. How would the government cover that 

159
00:08:42.314 --> 00:08:46.025
 up or how would rock and roll music cause cancer 

160
00:08:46.102 --> 00:08:49.040
 so you can always ask these questions? 

161
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.810
 Why and how an you know, 

162
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.370
 maybe they have a good explanation. 

163
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.474
 But it's good to ask these questions to find out 

164
00:08:57.559 --> 00:09:01.150
 more about why they think what they think. 

165
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:05.780
 You can also counter what they're saying meaning if they 

166
00:09:05.863 --> 00:09:07.020
 say something, 

167
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.508
 and you disagree you can say your opinion so for 

168
00:09:11.602 --> 00:09:12.350
 example. 

169
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:18.245
 If somebody told you that Kim Kardashian is really Michael 

170
00:09:18.347 --> 00:09:19.160
 Jackson. 

171
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.394
 You can say the fact of the matter is Michael 

172
00:09:23.488 --> 00:09:25.370
 Jackson passed away. 

173
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.900
 He is not Kim Kardashian. 

174
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.916
 The truth is Michael Jackson and Kim Kardashian or not 

175
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.180
 the same person. 

176
00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.300
 You can also say in reality. 

177
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.540
 In reality, Michael Jackson is not Kim Kardashian. 

178
00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.560
 So these are great expressions, 

179
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.070
 you can use when you're trying to tell somebody that 

180
00:09:46.137 --> 00:09:50.187
 what they're saying is incorrect and that what you're saying 

181
00:09:50.255 --> 00:09:51.740
 is the correct belief. 

182
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.682
 OK so we've gone over all these different things to 

183
00:09:54.739 --> 00:09:54.970
 say. 

184
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.875
 When somebody tells you something that's not true so let's 

185
00:09:58.942 --> 00:09:59.750
 practice it. 

186
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:04.080
 OK, this just in fake news story. 

187
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:10.509
 Did you hear terrorists have melted Antarctica using a giant 

188
00:10:10.616 --> 00:10:11.580
 laser OK, 

189
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:18.510
 so terrorists have melted Antarctica using a gigantic laser? 

190
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.370
 So that's the news story, 

191
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.940
 which I just made up. 

192
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.330
 It's fake news. So, your source is Emma. 

193
00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.091
 And this is not a good source for this news 

194
00:10:28.155 --> 00:10:28.540
 story. 

195
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.083
 So what can you say to me if I give 

196
00:10:31.155 --> 00:10:33.480
 you a fake news story like that? 

197
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.907
 Or maybe you'll say that's not true you might say 

198
00:10:39.018 --> 00:10:42.230
 where did you hear that Emma? 

199
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:46.810
 Why would terrorists melt Antarctica with a giant laser? 

200
00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.953
 How would terrorists get the laser so you might ask 

201
00:10:51.034 --> 00:10:55.340
 these questions and then you might tell me the truth. 

202
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.349
 The fact of the matter is an Arctica has not 

203
00:10:59.441 --> 00:11:03.450
 been melted by terrorists that is fake news. 

204
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:07.179

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.955
 Also, maybe some expressions you can use when you hear 

208
00:11:16.028 --> 00:11:17.850
