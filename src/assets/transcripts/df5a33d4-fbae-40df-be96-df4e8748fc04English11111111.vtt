00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.129
Let me give you some advice bastard never forget what

NOTE Confidence: 0.902765

00:00:05.226 --> 00:00:06.000
you are.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75479

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.520
Parents like armor, it can never be used ahead.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86794

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.543
When I first heard they were interested in me for

NOTE Confidence: 0.86794

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:13.530
a fantasy show.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86794

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.665
I went no either the inkling reading the first boot

NOTE Confidence: 0.86794

00:00:16.726 --> 00:00:17.710
going Oh my God,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8460024

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.990
this is. This is amazing list could really kick off.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900184

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.289
I was quite young and I had such a big

NOTE Confidence: 0.900184

00:00:28.343 --> 00:00:29.860
imagination in those scenes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900184

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.884
When I was younger. I would have really convinced myself

NOTE Confidence: 0.900184

00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:34.990
that I was there and it was happening,

NOTE Confidence: 0.900184

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.108
you know they've never had any experience of acting before

NOTE Confidence: 0.900184

00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:40.903
I went to a very theatrically based drama school do

NOTE Confidence: 0.900184

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:43.000
3 hours of camera training in 3 years,

NOTE Confidence: 0.900184

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.489
but then my fourth hour in front of the camera

NOTE Confidence: 0.900184

00:00:45.543 --> 00:00:47.220
was day one on Game of Thrones.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900184

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.880
My first turn step was causal.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900184

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.430
Black my first scene was uh.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900184

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.339
There's just a very quick scene where I'm walking down

NOTE Confidence: 0.900184

00:00:53.393 --> 00:00:55.601
the ramp arts and I was so nervous for my

NOTE Confidence: 0.900184

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:56.140
birthday.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900184

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.630
I'd set coming God, I fell off of.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82518

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.310
This is my first job,

NOTE Confidence: 0.82518

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.740
but this is like the first thing I ever did.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82518

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.383
And they stuck in a horse I was falling off

NOTE Confidence: 0.82518

00:01:07.468 --> 00:01:10.010
the horse trying to act still.

NOTE Confidence: 0.772072

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.443
OK, I fell again place and that was the king's

NOTE Confidence: 0.772072

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:15.310
arrival.

NOTE Confidence: 0.772072

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.772
The King writes in on horseback and he has to

NOTE Confidence: 0.772072

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:24.531
get off his horse and his robe was enormous the

NOTE Confidence: 0.772072

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.100
horse rides and he's like and then.

NOTE Confidence: 0.825824

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.503
Hold everyone and then they run in with with making

NOTE Confidence: 0.825824

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:32.370
like ladder.

NOTE Confidence: 0.825824

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.833
They held him down and run out with the Latin

NOTE Confidence: 0.825824

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:36.910
and carry on.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909656

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.486
I vaguely remember it was like Sean Bean and Mark

NOTE Confidence: 0.909656

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:44.427
Addy and Lena and I remember being so overwhelmed and

NOTE Confidence: 0.909656

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.230
terrified.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909656

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.859
I remember everybody clear remember baby Sophie and baby mezien

NOTE Confidence: 0.909656

00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:50.300
baby.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909656

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.410
I zic and now they're out there full grown.

NOTE Confidence: 0.854306

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.240
The most shocking scene that I didn't see coming.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900491

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.808
From then on, I started to distrust the show as

NOTE Confidence: 0.900491

00:02:07.884 --> 00:02:12.060
to like whether they kill my favorite character or not.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900491

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.750
I think the most shocking was probably my death,

NOTE Confidence: 0.900491

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.910
the hotel moment I couldn't quite believe.

NOTE Confidence: 0.905727

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.200
That was such as of Oh my God,

NOTE Confidence: 0.905727

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.591
I watched the Red Wedding and I had didn't really

NOTE Confidence: 0.905727

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.560
read into it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.905727

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.880
Then the script of what happened.

NOTE Confidence: 0.905727

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.240
I think I just did.

NOTE Confidence: 0.905727

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.440
My Burton went lala and then when it came out.

NOTE Confidence: 0.905727

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.630
I remember I watched it in the morning big guy

NOTE Confidence: 0.905727

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:40.670
big tough guy,

NOTE Confidence: 0.905727

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.120
but guess what? I burst into tears.

NOTE Confidence: 0.905727

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.620
I was an absolute shocker remember just fortune going no

NOTE Confidence: 0.905727

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.870
no no no no no no no Watts.

NOTE Confidence: 0.928754

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.330
It was brilliant.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8745

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.180
Do I have to call you lady start now?

NOTE Confidence: 0.898776

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.445
Yes, my favorite day on set would be the day

NOTE Confidence: 0.898776

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.006
that I was reunited with Maisie that day on sat

NOTE Confidence: 0.898776

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.490
I've never laughed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.898776

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.960
So much in my life.

NOTE Confidence: 0.898776

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.200
It was so much fun the day with the wheels.

NOTE Confidence: 0.898776

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.473
I've still got that video jeez mean so if we

NOTE Confidence: 0.898776

00:03:14.547 --> 00:03:17.150
just messing around on Brownsville.

NOTE Confidence: 0.898776

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.210
I think the most fun scene.

NOTE Confidence: 0.898776

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.830
We shot was season 7.

NOTE Confidence: 0.898776

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.810
We shot this big sequence,

NOTE Confidence: 0.898776

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.420
the loot train attack and we shot that in Spain.

NOTE Confidence: 0.898776

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.980
It was such a beautiful.

NOTE Confidence: 0.848022

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.696
And there's something about being outside everyday and being on

NOTE Confidence: 0.848022

00:03:33.771 --> 00:03:34.520
horseback.

NOTE Confidence: 0.848022

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.360
I love riding go bag 80.

NOTE Confidence: 0.848022

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.481
Season 3, getting the unsullied was the first time that

NOTE Confidence: 0.848022

00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:41.980
I Amelia got to be.

NOTE Confidence: 0.848022

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.316
You know like Benton birders negate dinettes gel mass more

NOTE Confidence: 0.848022

00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:48.110
entered Gary or lantra.

NOTE Confidence: 0.848022

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.620
Drake carries it was really cool.

NOTE Confidence: 0.848022

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.412
Favorite day on set was definitely day in a suit

NOTE Confidence: 0.848022

00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:58.916
of when we were doing the gladitorial sequence my little

NOTE Confidence: 0.848022

00:03:58.995 --> 00:04:00.180
girl was there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876833

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.866
She watched the Papa work David said to you know

NOTE Confidence: 0.876833

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:07.246
come sit here you can call and she was like

NOTE Confidence: 0.876833

00:04:07.322 --> 00:04:07.860
action.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876833

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.236
The fights between the hound and Brienne of fucking tarth

NOTE Confidence: 0.876833

00:04:12.313 --> 00:04:15.000
would studied and trained for that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876833

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.090
Long time and going to all came to freshen that

NOTE Confidence: 0.876833

00:04:19.177 --> 00:04:20.830
was just fantastic.

NOTE Confidence: 0.882011

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.248
Iceland season 2, the first day we were that that

NOTE Confidence: 0.882011

00:04:24.317 --> 00:04:26.410
was my favorite down on front.

NOTE Confidence: 0.882011

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.918
I had never been to a more beautiful place in

NOTE Confidence: 0.882011

00:04:29.996 --> 00:04:33.660
my life and it was special for so many reasons.

NOTE Confidence: 0.920171

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.220
It was the scene where I was.

NOTE Confidence: 0.776172

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.300
Not able to Purdy grip.

NOTE Confidence: 0.848813

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.200
Strike hard and true. Jon Snow.

NOTE Confidence: 0.898681

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.270
My favorite actor to work with his rose.

NOTE Confidence: 0.898681

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.133
Leslie there was something really special about working with rose

NOTE Confidence: 0.898681

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:53.430
now.

NOTE Confidence: 0.898681

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.360
I really, really enjoy working with John Bradley,

NOTE Confidence: 0.864745

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.700
he saw this. Elevation.

NOTE Confidence: 0.924498

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.965
A really enjoyed the scene with Mark Addy way back

NOTE Confidence: 0.924498

00:05:05.028 --> 00:05:05.900
in season one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.924498

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.990
Just 'cause it was so it's hence.

NOTE Confidence: 0.924498

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.190
No, I was like pages and pages long and it

NOTE Confidence: 0.924498

00:05:11.266 --> 00:05:14.770
was really unexpected from those 2 characters.

NOTE Confidence: 0.927972

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.470
Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.

NOTE Confidence: 0.828763

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.010
Call marriage.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87157

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.309
Doesn't ease that I get with acting within Glen Cassis

NOTE Confidence: 0.87157

00:05:24.388 --> 00:05:28.130
pin my power the whole time there's been my one

NOTE Confidence: 0.87157

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.190
my buddy in the most beautiful thing about Amelia.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87157

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.800
She has no idea how good she is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87157

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.370
She genuinely's no idea and she still has no idea.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89973

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.589
She's always of vulnerable which gives his part of her

NOTE Confidence: 0.89973

00:05:42.648 --> 00:05:43.900
part of a great gift.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89973

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.660
I think in terms of my favorite scene partner.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89973

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.293
They would have to be kit kit with the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.89973

00:05:49.353 --> 00:05:50.430
person I ever had,

NOTE Confidence: 0.89973

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.570
and acting relationship with because it was my first job.

NOTE Confidence: 0.911489

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.186
I think that the friendships that you for when you

NOTE Confidence: 0.911489

00:05:57.238 --> 00:05:59.802
are a bit scared and a bit uncertain and treading

NOTE Confidence: 0.911489

00:05:59.854 --> 00:06:01.110
unfamiliar ground there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.911489

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.225
The ones that tend to stick because you cling onto

NOTE Confidence: 0.911489

00:06:04.287 --> 00:06:05.720
each other for support.

NOTE Confidence: 0.839542

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.290
Santa come here little dove.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900577

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.980
I always loved working with Lena?

NOTE Confidence: 0.900577

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.690
What are you doing? Pray.

NOTE Confidence: 0.890707368421052

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.749
Perfect honey. Praying just watching her and learning from how

NOTE Confidence: 0.890707368421052

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.910
was the best drama lesson I could've ever hopeful?

NOTE Confidence: 0.813897

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.659
I just paid my King your father now paying the

NOTE Confidence: 0.813897

00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:28.230
price.

NOTE Confidence: 0.794409

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.226
I don't care. You my friend sure I'd accomplish things

NOTE Confidence: 0.794409

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.778
were Terrien that I love down to have her level

NOTE Confidence: 0.794409

00:06:35.852 --> 00:06:36.740
of humanity.

NOTE Confidence: 0.885871

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.280
On decency and cleverness and brightness.

NOTE Confidence: 0.885871

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.101
He just treat her as an equal and I really

NOTE Confidence: 0.885871

00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:45.660
like that aspect not the relationship that they had.

NOTE Confidence: 0.896987

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.350
I really miss Charles Dance,

NOTE Confidence: 0.896987

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.550
who played my father Tywin Lannister.

NOTE Confidence: 0.896987

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.360
We had such a great chemistry.

NOTE Confidence: 0.896987

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.378
And a great friendship to noon RESP ITE are onscreen

NOTE Confidence: 0.896987

00:06:54.436 --> 00:06:55.190
relationship.

NOTE Confidence: 0.947869

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.883
I'm very fortunate to work with the greatest cast everybody

NOTE Confidence: 0.947869

00:07:02.962 --> 00:07:05.880
is so professional and so incredibly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900688

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.131
Kind and generous to their fellow actors everyone involved is

NOTE Confidence: 0.900688

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.430
like a family and it's a family.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900688

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.262
That amazingly still laughs and gets on with each other

NOTE Confidence: 0.900688

00:07:16.332 --> 00:07:18.910
89 years in the dustbin not assholes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900688

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.810
North people depots. There's been normal.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900688

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.459
Nothing not even a suggestion when it's all said and

NOTE Confidence: 0.900688

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:25.880
done.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900688

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.770
I'll miss the dynamic of the show 'cause.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900688

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.410
There's nothing like this show or in Game of Thrones

NOTE Confidence: 0.900688

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.950
means in my twenties.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900688

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.680
I started this job when I was 22.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909922

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.333
And I am not 22 anymore Game of Thrones is

NOTE Confidence: 0.909922

00:07:39.396 --> 00:07:40.470
my entire career.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909922

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.950
I think I am going to have a hard time,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909922000000001

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.823
saying goodbye to Sam is going to be very hard

NOTE Confidence: 0.909922000000001

00:07:45.885 --> 00:07:48.695
to say goodbye to paid theory and I will miss

NOTE Confidence: 0.909922000000001

00:07:48.758 --> 00:07:51.880
simple things like walking on to set for the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.909922

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.757
time each year in your new bits of costume and

NOTE Confidence: 0.909922

00:07:54.819 --> 00:07:58.197
just knowing you're part of something which is sort of

NOTE Confidence: 0.909922

00:07:58.259 --> 00:07:59.760
the center of attention.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909922

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.930
Yes, can be very strange without has been 8 years.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909922

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.276
I'll tell you why won't miss what Morrone with a

NOTE Confidence: 0.909922

00:08:06.346 --> 00:08:07.880
half of fucking beard.

NOTE Confidence: 0.746906

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.630
Is the year?

NOTE Confidence: 0.860277

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:14.064
Please turn brother. I was like a little puppy when

NOTE Confidence: 0.860277

00:08:14.151 --> 00:08:15.020
I arrived.

NOTE Confidence: 0.860277

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.676
I was like Bambi. Uh on the ice and coming

NOTE Confidence: 0.860277

00:08:18.763 --> 00:08:19.720
to Belfast.

NOTE Confidence: 0.860277

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.830
Just I learned how to walk.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919382

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.310
With Pride and joy, I've grown up with these people.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919382

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.585
I've changed so much as a person because of these

NOTE Confidence: 0.919382

00:08:29.652 --> 00:08:30.120
people.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919382

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.771
I'm so confident I've just got this confidence from the

NOTE Confidence: 0.919382

00:08:33.838 --> 00:08:35.630
show and from playing Aria?

NOTE Confidence: 0.919382

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.617
I really feel like I just want to inject that

NOTE Confidence: 0.919382

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:41.870
into each and every person that I know and love.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919382

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.149
But then also any girl that admires the work that

NOTE Confidence: 0.919382

00:08:45.215 --> 00:08:45.550
I do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919382

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.345
The journey that I've been on with Daenerys has sharpened

NOTE Confidence: 0.919382

00:08:49.411 --> 00:08:50.410
be as an actor.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919382

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.589
It's shown me the range that I can do and

NOTE Confidence: 0.919382

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:54.830
because of the.

NOTE Confidence: 0.904121

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:58.094
Those 2 it's forced me to find them within myself

NOTE Confidence: 0.904121

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.424
Game of Thrones has been such an education for me

NOTE Confidence: 0.904121

00:09:01.491 --> 00:09:02.490
and everything,

NOTE Confidence: 0.904121

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.480
having to be around adults from the age of 10

NOTE Confidence: 0.904121

00:09:05.547 --> 00:09:08.670
and work on a professional set get up and learn

NOTE Confidence: 0.904121

00:09:08.736 --> 00:09:12.590
your lines and really think about character is also taught

NOTE Confidence: 0.904121

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.500
me a lot about myself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915704

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.820
As an actor, you work,

NOTE Confidence: 0.915704000000001

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.762
and work and work and you auditioning you don't get

NOTE Confidence: 0.915704000000001

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.935
parts and you do get parts and sometimes they're great

NOTE Confidence: 0.915704000000001

00:09:22.993 --> 00:09:26.570
experiences and sometimes they really shitty and this is being

NOTE Confidence: 0.915704000000001

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.200
incredible. Thrones is the Holy Grail where it's something that

NOTE Confidence: 0.915704000000001

00:09:30.258 --> 00:09:34.004
is enormously globally massively popular and people think is cool

NOTE Confidence: 0.915704000000001

00:09:34.061 --> 00:09:37.000
where people are always trying to copy things or do

NOTE Confidence: 0.915704

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.248
variations of things to where you get something which is

NOTE Confidence: 0.915704

00:09:40.306 --> 00:09:41.930
completely original fantasy.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915704

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.301
It's the most realistic show that I've ever done that

NOTE Confidence: 0.915704

00:09:45.364 --> 00:09:46.700
also happens to have.

NOTE Confidence: 0.905975

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.090
Ends and dead people walking around in it,

NOTE Confidence: 0.905975

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.344
I think a lot of fantasy is heavy on the

NOTE Confidence: 0.905975

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.330
dragon in light on the character where the opposite.

NOTE Confidence: 0.905975

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.280
This show will be discovered by generations to come.

NOTE Confidence: 0.905975

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.344
It's timeless every season. There's something else bigger than the

NOTE Confidence: 0.905975

00:10:01.406 --> 00:10:04.607
last season and better than the last season and here

NOTE Confidence: 0.905975

00:10:04.669 --> 00:10:05.100
we are.

NOTE Confidence: 0.895296

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:09.580
Season 8 it's cinematic were making 10 hour movies every

NOTE Confidence: 0.895296

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.060
year.

NOTE Confidence: 0.895296

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.744
The fact that this is really a full stop on

NOTE Confidence: 0.895296

00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:18.284
this story is sad because I think everyone's been so

NOTE Confidence: 0.895296

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.340
invested in this story.

NOTE Confidence: 0.877358

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.980
That we never want to see this come too close,

NOTE Confidence: 0.877358

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.770
but it must and it will be good.
