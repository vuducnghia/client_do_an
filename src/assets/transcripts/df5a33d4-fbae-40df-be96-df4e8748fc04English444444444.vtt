Hi welcome again to invade.com my name is Adam today.

NOTE Confidence: 0.927451

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.421
We're going to look at something that I get asked

NOTE Confidence: 0.927451

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:12.293
about all the time so I would that I lost

NOTE Confidence: 0.927451

00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:13.250
my cap there,

NOTE Confidence: 0.927451

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.300
OK, so people students. Ask me all the time?

NOTE Confidence: 0.927451

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.870
What's the difference between though,

NOTE Confidence: 0.927451

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.446
although and even though and despite and in spite of

NOTE Confidence: 0.927451

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:23.340
very simple.

NOTE Confidence: 0.927451

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.790
It's not as complicated as everybody thinks first.

NOTE Confidence: 0.927451

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.560
Let's start with these 3.

NOTE Confidence: 0.927451

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.349
These 3, though, although and even though these are used

NOTE Confidence: 0.927451

00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:33.770
with adverb clauses.

NOTE Confidence: 0.93602

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.370
Now just to refresh your memory?

NOTE Confidence: 0.936019999999999

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.709
What is a clause a clause is any group of

NOTE Confidence: 0.936019999999999

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.291
words that has a subject and a verb it must

NOTE Confidence: 0.936019999999999

00:00:45.373 --> 00:00:47.490
have a subject and a verb.

NOTE Confidence: 0.946601

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.220
And these 3 are used to show contrast.

NOTE Confidence: 0.926886

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.690
So what does all this mean in general,

NOTE Confidence: 0.926886

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.087
you're going to have a long sentence this sentence is

NOTE Confidence: 0.926886

00:00:59.152 --> 00:01:00.690
going to have 2 clauses.

NOTE Confidence: 0.926886

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.670
One clause will have this adverb marker in it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.926886

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.763
The other clause will be an independent clause means it's

NOTE Confidence: 0.926886

00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:10.420
a sentence that can stand by itself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.936342

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.547
And this does is it shows a contrast or something

NOTE Confidence: 0.936342

00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:17.249
that's very different from one clause to the other clause

NOTE Confidence: 0.936342

00:01:17.313 --> 00:01:19.100
so within that one sentence.

NOTE Confidence: 0.936342

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.937
You have contrasting ideas like positive and negative or you

NOTE Confidence: 0.936342

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:24.920
think this is going to happen,

NOTE Confidence: 0.936342

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.700
but it really that happens,

NOTE Confidence: 0.936342

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.370
something very different from what you expect.

NOTE Confidence: 0.939148

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.600
Despite and in spite of these are prepositions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.920946

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.960
And they are used with a phrase now,

NOTE Confidence: 0.920946

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.838
what is a phrase a phrase is also a group

NOTE Confidence: 0.920946

00:01:43.908 --> 00:01:44.540
of words.

NOTE Confidence: 0.920946

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.498
But it doesn't need to have a subject in a

NOTE Confidence: 0.920946

00:01:47.568 --> 00:01:47.920
verb.

NOTE Confidence: 0.920946

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.493
It can have a noun or it could have a

NOTE Confidence: 0.920946

00:01:50.563 --> 00:01:53.902
verb or it could have neither but usually it has

NOTE Confidence: 0.920946

00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:55.710
at least one or a gerund,

NOTE Confidence: 0.920946

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.290
but we'll get to that,

NOTE Confidence: 0.920946

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.150
but it also shows contrast.

NOTE Confidence: 0.927989

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.718
OK, before I give you some example sentences to understand

NOTE Confidence: 0.927989

00:02:05.786 --> 00:02:06.400
all this,

NOTE Confidence: 0.927989

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.760
let's look at each one separately,

NOTE Confidence: 0.927989

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.780
though, and although what is the difference?

NOTE Confidence: 0.927989

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.644
No difference, though, is this a little bit more informal

NOTE Confidence: 0.927989

00:02:15.712 --> 00:02:18.695
you can use either one at the beginning of a

NOTE Confidence: 0.927989

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:21.000
sentence or middle of a sentence.

NOTE Confidence: 0.927989

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.620
The biggest difference is that you can end a sentence

NOTE Confidence: 0.927989

00:02:24.688 --> 00:02:25.030
with,

NOTE Confidence: 0.927989

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.840
though you can't really end a sentence with although and

NOTE Confidence: 0.927989

00:02:28.908 --> 00:02:31.290
again when you end a sentence with,

NOTE Confidence: 0.896953416666667

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.288
though. Formal sentence OK, so you have to keep that

NOTE Confidence: 0.896953416666667

00:02:35.365 --> 00:02:35.980
in mind,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9160376

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.520
so informal. Now that doesn't mean that this is formal.

NOTE Confidence: 0.921514

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.419
It just means that this is informal if that makes

NOTE Confidence: 0.921514

00:02:42.478 --> 00:02:43.070
any sense.

NOTE Confidence: 0.92468

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.583
How 'bout even though even though also shows a contrast

NOTE Confidence: 0.92468

00:02:47.665 --> 00:02:51.850
but it's a much stronger contrast it adds emphasis?

NOTE Confidence: 0.940742

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.690
But what is the emphasis on OK this is?

NOTE Confidence: 0.940742

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.448
What is important? What is the emphasis placed on the

NOTE Confidence: 0.940742

00:02:58.519 --> 00:02:59.370
expectation?

NOTE Confidence: 0.942675

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.082
So for example, the beginning of the sentence has one

NOTE Confidence: 0.942675

00:03:05.144 --> 00:03:08.090
idea so you think this must be the second part,

NOTE Confidence: 0.942675

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.473
but no something very different is the second part and

NOTE Confidence: 0.942675

00:03:11.535 --> 00:03:14.730
this is a very strong emphasis on this expectation.

NOTE Confidence: 0.942675

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.210
When I give you some example sentences,

NOTE Confidence: 0.942675

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.310
you'll understand what I'm talking about.

NOTE Confidence: 0.93213

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.486
Despite and in spite of these are exactly the same

NOTE Confidence: 0.93213

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.160
except one word 3 words for this one right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.93213

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.164
But they work. The exact same way you can interchange

NOTE Confidence: 0.93213

00:03:33.258 --> 00:03:33.730
them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.894172

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.968
One mistake that many people do they say in despite

NOTE Confidence: 0.894172

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.200
of or this?

NOTE Confidence: 0.926504

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.980
Despite of something they mix them be very careful.

NOTE Confidence: 0.926504

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.760
Despite your face. In spite of your face don't mix.

NOTE Confidence: 0.926504

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.304
The 2 up. There 2 different things with the same

NOTE Confidence: 0.926504

00:03:51.378 --> 00:03:52.190
meaning OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.926504

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.449
This will be much clearer once I put up some

NOTE Confidence: 0.926504

00:03:55.523 --> 00:03:56.190
examples,

NOTE Confidence: 0.926504

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.160
so let's do that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.934002

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.430
OK let's start with although though,

NOTE Confidence: 0.934002

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.151
and even though I have basically the same sentence for

NOTE Confidence: 0.934002

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.460
different ways OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90562

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.730
Although the exam was difficult.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90562

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.730
I think I did well now here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90562

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.590
The contrast is between difficult and doing well right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90562

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.960
That's the contrast difficult means doing badly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90562

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.580
But here is an opposite OK very easy.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90562

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.876
I started with although I'll give you the opposite because

NOTE Confidence: 0.90562

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.431
you're a subject and here is your verb and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.90562

00:04:28.505 --> 00:04:32.060
here's your subjects and here's your verb again.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90365

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.186
We want to talk about the extra clause at the

NOTE Confidence: 0.90365

00:04:35.255 --> 00:04:35.950
end there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90365

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.495
That's your main one now same sentence I can switch

NOTE Confidence: 0.90365

00:04:39.565 --> 00:04:40.260
it around.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90365

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.380
I can say. I think I did well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90365

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.610
Although the exam was difficult beginning and doesn't matter.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90365

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.350
The only difference would be the comma.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90365

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.940
If you put this as the second clause.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90365

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.905
No comma if you begin a sentence with the adverb

NOTE Confidence: 0.90365

00:04:55.988 --> 00:04:57.970
marker you have a comma.

NOTE Confidence: 0.941841

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.270
I think I did well,

NOTE Confidence: 0.941841

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.970
though the exam was difficult.

NOTE Confidence: 0.759785333333333

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.300
OK. So that's

NOTE Confidence: 0.913655

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.390
My mistake there sorry about that here we have it

NOTE Confidence: 0.913655

00:05:08.453 --> 00:05:11.290
in the second part I could put although here,

NOTE Confidence: 0.913655

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.860
I could put though here,

NOTE Confidence: 0.913655

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.027
both would be OK doesn't change the meaning of the

NOTE Confidence: 0.913655

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.660
sentence.

NOTE Confidence: 0.913655

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.510
One is just informal one is just regular no problem.

NOTE Confidence: 0.922274

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.837
Here, what I did is I wanted to show you

NOTE Confidence: 0.922274

00:05:22.895 --> 00:05:24.350
how to put it at the end,

NOTE Confidence: 0.922274

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.518
so I split up the sentence into 2 the exam

NOTE Confidence: 0.922274

00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:28.650
was difficult.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909996444444445

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.900
Period sentence is finished. I think I did well,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9121508125

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.518
though. Now here I put a comma when I put

NOTE Confidence: 0.9121508125

00:05:35.582 --> 00:05:37.370
bill with the end now again.

NOTE Confidence: 0.911023

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.612
This is informal. This is people how people speak sometimes

NOTE Confidence: 0.911023

00:05:40.667 --> 00:05:42.150
you can have it in writing,

NOTE Confidence: 0.911023

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.620
but not in formal writing,

NOTE Confidence: 0.911023

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.562
but you see how I can put us at the

NOTE Confidence: 0.911023

00:05:45.618 --> 00:05:45.840
end.

NOTE Confidence: 0.911023

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.290
I can't put although here that doesn't work.

NOTE Confidence: 0.911023

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.370
You have to use it,

NOTE Confidence: 0.911023

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.150
though at the end of the sentence in informal situations.

NOTE Confidence: 0.918379

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.731
Now here I change the sentence a little bit even

NOTE Confidence: 0.918379

00:05:56.805 --> 00:05:58.670
though the exam was easy.

NOTE Confidence: 0.918379

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.900
I failed now, what's the difference here?

NOTE Confidence: 0.926506

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.280
The exam was difficult. I think I did well so

NOTE Confidence: 0.926506

00:06:05.332 --> 00:06:06.390
there is a contrast,

NOTE Confidence: 0.926506

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.060
but it's not very strong contrast right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.92508

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.956
Here the exam was easy so if I hear the

NOTE Confidence: 0.92508

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.070
exam was easy.

NOTE Confidence: 0.92508

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.750
I expect that you did,

NOTE Confidence: 0.92508

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.670
very well right. That's the whole idea.

NOTE Confidence: 0.92508

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.611
But I failed that's drastic drastic means it's completely different

NOTE Confidence: 0.92508

00:06:22.685 --> 00:06:24.750
result than what I expected.

NOTE Confidence: 0.92508

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.524
That's why I'm using the even though even though it

NOTE Confidence: 0.92508

00:06:28.598 --> 00:06:29.930
was easy I failed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.92508

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.407
This should not happen. After this right so the difference

NOTE Confidence: 0.92508

00:06:34.484 --> 00:06:38.344
is so strong from the expectation that you want to

NOTE Confidence: 0.92508

00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:40.660
use even though to emphasize.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909797

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.991
Seems that difference OK, I hope everybody understands that more

NOTE Confidence: 0.909797

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:45.600
or less.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909797

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.070
Their exact same in most situations.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909797

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.574
You can use any one of the 3 it won't

NOTE Confidence: 0.909797

00:06:50.642 --> 00:06:52.740
make that much of a difference.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909797

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.280
This one has a certain feeling to it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909797

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.079
A strong difference. So when you're writing an essay for

NOTE Confidence: 0.909797

00:06:59.147 --> 00:06:59.690
example,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909797

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.160
sometimes it will make a difference.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909797

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.890
Even though or although but usually not.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909797

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.430
Let's look at despite in spite of OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909797

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.791
Now let's look at despite and in spite of so

NOTE Confidence: 0.909797

00:07:10.867 --> 00:07:11.860
first of all.

NOTE Confidence: 0.912305

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.950
His best efforts, the man just couldn't succeed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.912305

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.280
Sorry forgot to put a little period,

NOTE Confidence: 0.912305

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.300
there at the end, OK now first?

NOTE Confidence: 0.912305

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.200
What does it mean it means he tried his best?

NOTE Confidence: 0.912305

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.525
He tried and tried and tried but always failed could

NOTE Confidence: 0.912305

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:26.740
never succeed now?

NOTE Confidence: 0.912305

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.720
What do you notice about this sentence here?

NOTE Confidence: 0.920624

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.110
There is no verb right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.920624

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.592
It's only a phrase. This is what we call a

NOTE Confidence: 0.920624

00:07:34.651 --> 00:07:35.360
phrase here,

NOTE Confidence: 0.920624

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.560
you have your regular independent clause with your subject and

NOTE Confidence: 0.920624

00:07:39.628 --> 00:07:41.050
your verb no problem.

NOTE Confidence: 0.93449

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.240
In spite of his best efforts,

NOTE Confidence: 0.93449

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.728
the man just couldn't succeed exactly the same meaning OK

NOTE Confidence: 0.93449

00:07:47.807 --> 00:07:50.720
this one expression versus the other.

NOTE Confidence: 0.91854

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.732
Again, I can change it around the man just couldn't

NOTE Confidence: 0.91854

00:07:54.811 --> 00:07:55.440
succeed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.91854

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.860
Despite his best efforts, the man just couldn't succeed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.91854

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.180
In spite of his best efforts,

NOTE Confidence: 0.91854

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:07.151
same, meaning another way, we can use despite and in

NOTE Confidence: 0.91854

00:08:07.247 --> 00:08:10.880
spite of is with a gerund an ING verb.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89368

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.800
This is called a gerund.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89368

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.177
It's an ING verb, but we use it like a

NOTE Confidence: 0.89368

00:08:16.266 --> 00:08:19.910
noun so here the phrase is being on time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.906284

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.270
To the lecture not so important,

NOTE Confidence: 0.906284

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.560
so despite being on time means,

NOTE Confidence: 0.906284

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.630
although he was on time see.

NOTE Confidence: 0.906284

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.060
I can make some up.

NOTE Confidence: 0.906284

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.837
It's exact same meaning we were not admitted we were

NOTE Confidence: 0.906284

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.290
not allowed inside,

NOTE Confidence: 0.906284

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:36.535
so keep in mind, despite and in spite of mean

NOTE Confidence: 0.906284

00:08:36.607 --> 00:08:40.069
the same as although but despite and in spite of

NOTE Confidence: 0.906284

00:08:40.141 --> 00:08:41.800
we use with the phrase.

NOTE Confidence: 0.906284

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.870
Although we use with 'cause.

NOTE Confidence: 0.906284

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.999
Otherwise, same, meaning if you're not sure and you still

NOTE Confidence: 0.906284

00:08:48.071 --> 00:08:49.520
have some questions,

NOTE Confidence: 0.908958
