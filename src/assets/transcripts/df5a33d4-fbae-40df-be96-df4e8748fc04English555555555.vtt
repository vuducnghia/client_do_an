00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.109
Hello my name is Emma and this is my friend

NOTE Confidence: 0.917797

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:08.600
gizmo and today we are going to help you learn

NOTE Confidence: 0.917797

00:00:08.696 --> 00:00:09.460
English.

NOTE Confidence: 0.917797

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.526
Today's English is all about dogs so let's ask some

NOTE Confidence: 0.917797

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:15.120
questions to gizmo.

NOTE Confidence: 0.917797

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.000
Anne we can get some answers.

NOTE Confidence: 0.873887

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.004
Our first question do we call pets key she or

NOTE Confidence: 0.873887

00:00:22.093 --> 00:00:22.360
it?

NOTE Confidence: 0.873887

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.600
What do you think gizmo?

NOTE Confidence: 0.912568

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.003
Usually, for pets, we like to use he or she

NOTE Confidence: 0.912568

00:00:29.083 --> 00:00:29.320
OK,

NOTE Confidence: 0.912568

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.333
so you might ask somebody what's her name or what's

NOTE Confidence: 0.912568

00:00:33.412 --> 00:00:34.120
his name.

NOTE Confidence: 0.912568

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.380
When you're talking about a dog or a cat.

NOTE Confidence: 0.912568

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.170
We usually use it for wild animals,

NOTE Confidence: 0.912568

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.650
although sometimes we also use.

NOTE Confidence: 0.912568

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.951
He and she if we want to personify them so

NOTE Confidence: 0.912568

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:48.230
majority of the time we use,

NOTE Confidence: 0.912568

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.710
he or she were talking about pets.

NOTE Confidence: 0.902385

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.560
OK, question number 2? What is pet hair called?

NOTE Confidence: 0.840942

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.090
Do you know the answer to this one gizmo?

NOTE Confidence: 0.847141

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.971
It is called fur FUR fur as you can see

NOTE Confidence: 0.847141

00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:05.360
gizmo has a lot of fur.

NOTE Confidence: 0.847141

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.128
We use the word fur when we're talking about Pat

NOTE Confidence: 0.847141

00:01:10.227 --> 00:01:12.710
her dog hair hamster her.

NOTE Confidence: 0.847141

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.040
It's what we call fur.

NOTE Confidence: 0.905702

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.640
OK, our next question what are pet hands called?

NOTE Confidence: 0.81527

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.480
Let's show gizmos off so gizmo.

NOTE Confidence: 0.81527

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.608
What is this called this is a paw so dogs

NOTE Confidence: 0.81527

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:33.440
and cats have paws just going to put gizmo down

NOTE Confidence: 0.81527

00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:34.850
for a second.

NOTE Confidence: 0.866961

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.120
There you go OK, so his hands are called pause.

NOTE Confidence: 0.925716

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.920
OK, our next question what does canine mean?

NOTE Confidence: 0.915431

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.116
9 is another way to say dog but canine is

NOTE Confidence: 0.915431

00:01:48.194 --> 00:01:51.780
more scientific sounding so if you're reading.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915431

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.771
A science book or something that's formal writing you will

NOTE Confidence: 0.915431

00:01:56.857 --> 00:02:02.106
probably see the word canine it's the science scientific word

NOTE Confidence: 0.915431

00:02:02.192 --> 00:02:02.880
for dog.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909589

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.670
We also have the word puppy?

NOTE Confidence: 0.909589

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.280
What does the word puppy mean?

NOTE Confidence: 0.907174

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.930
Puppy means a baby dog OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.907174

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.106
So when a dog is very small and very young

NOTE Confidence: 0.907174

00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:18.680
usually around you know 2 months to one year,

NOTE Confidence: 0.907174

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.330
we call it a puppy.

NOTE Confidence: 0.877922

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.984
For kittens that's what we call a baby cat a

NOTE Confidence: 0.877922

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.830
kitten.

NOTE Confidence: 0.928793

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.691
OK, our next question is very good one what sound

NOTE Confidence: 0.928793

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.947
does a dog make sounds are very cultural in different

NOTE Confidence: 0.928793

00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:39.990
cultures animals make different sounds for dogs in English dogs

NOTE Confidence: 0.909505375

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.236
can either bark. They can say woof woof or they

NOTE Confidence: 0.909505375

00:02:44.326 --> 00:02:48.843
can say Ruff Ruff is this different than what dogs

NOTE Confidence: 0.909505375

00:02:48.933 --> 00:02:50.830
say in your language.

NOTE Confidence: 0.921837

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.668
If you're wondering with cats or with you know all

NOTE Confidence: 0.921837

00:02:53.725 --> 00:02:55.030
sorts of other animals.

NOTE Confidence: 0.921837

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.390
You can actually check out Ronnies video,

NOTE Confidence: 0.921837

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.037
which covers a lot of these different animal sounds if

NOTE Confidence: 0.921837

00:03:01.104 --> 00:03:02.320
you're interested.

NOTE Confidence: 0.912303

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.080
OK finally our last question for vocabulary?

NOTE Confidence: 0.912303

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.291
What do you call a dog with no home so

NOTE Confidence: 0.912303

00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:12.839
a dog that lives in the streets we call a

NOTE Confidence: 0.912303

00:03:12.924 --> 00:03:14.360
dog with no home.

NOTE Confidence: 0.912303

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.702
A stray dog or we can also say a street

NOTE Confidence: 0.912303

00:03:17.787 --> 00:03:18.130
dog.

NOTE Confidence: 0.912303

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.390
So we would say that dog has no owner,

NOTE Confidence: 0.912303

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.215
He's without a family. He's a stray dog or he

NOTE Confidence: 0.912303

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.660
is a street dog.

NOTE Confidence: 0.912303

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.736
So now let's look at some grammar and pronunciation and

NOTE Confidence: 0.912303

00:03:31.828 --> 00:03:33.120
cultural tips.

NOTE Confidence: 0.907241636363636

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.746
About dogs. OK. So our next question is a grammar

NOTE Confidence: 0.907241636363636

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.690
question,

NOTE Confidence: 0.938055

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.850
and it's a very important grammar question.

NOTE Confidence: 0.887587

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.880
OK, so let me hold gizmo OK,

NOTE Confidence: 0.887587

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.190
so gizmo you see these 2 things.

NOTE Confidence: 0.887587

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.210
I like dogs. I like dogs do you know what?

NOTE Confidence: 0.887587

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.430
The difference between these 2 sentences are?

NOTE Confidence: 0.927692

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.120
No OK well let me tell you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.941469

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.870
I like dog is very different than I like dogs.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909643

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.141
When you want to say you like dogs as in

NOTE Confidence: 0.909643

00:04:06.223 --> 00:04:06.550
you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909643

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.853
You think they're really cute and funny and you enjoy

NOTE Confidence: 0.909643

00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:11.990
them You say,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909643

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.470
I like dogs with an S?

NOTE Confidence: 0.898093

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.176
This is different from I like dog with no S

NOTE Confidence: 0.898093

00:04:18.262 --> 00:04:19.210
if you say,

NOTE Confidence: 0.898093

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.884
I like dog. It makes it sound like you like

NOTE Confidence: 0.898093

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:26.130
to eat dog and this is true for a lot

NOTE Confidence: 0.898093

00:04:26.216 --> 00:04:28.010
of animals if we say,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9166561875

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.427
I like chikin. It means I like to eat chick

NOTE Confidence: 0.9166561875

00:04:31.507 --> 00:04:33.970
in this is very different from.

NOTE Confidence: 0.92094

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.860
I like chickens, which means I think chickens are cute.

NOTE Confidence: 0.92094

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.480
I enjoy chickens. And I find them very interesting,

NOTE Confidence: 0.92094

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.450
so the next question is a pronunciation question.

NOTE Confidence: 0.931497

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.904
And that is what is the pronunciation difference between dogs

NOTE Confidence: 0.931497

00:04:49.977 --> 00:04:52.970
and Ducks so a duck is an animal you know

NOTE Confidence: 0.931497

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:56.110
that says Quack Quack at least in English.

NOTE Confidence: 0.931497

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.175
It does an a lot of students when they say

NOTE Confidence: 0.931497

00:04:59.248 --> 00:05:03.336
these words pronounced them the same way so people don't

NOTE Confidence: 0.931497

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.620
know if you're talking about a dog or a duck

NOTE Confidence: 0.931497

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.300
So what is the difference in pronunciation?

NOTE Confidence: 0.894871

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.920
Well dog has a different vowel sound,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8875915

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.430
then duck. Dog is longer we say dog.

NOTE Confidence: 0.906138

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.519
Compare this to duck, which is very short and a

NOTE Confidence: 0.906138

00:05:24.627 --> 00:05:25.710
bit sharp.

NOTE Confidence: 0.861031

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.710
This is an aw sound dog.

NOTE Confidence: 0.828535333333333

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.407
Versus. Duck. OK, so you notice the vowel sound here

NOTE Confidence: 0.828535333333333

00:05:34.497 --> 00:05:35.310
is short,

NOTE Confidence: 0.875236

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.740
whereas the vowel sound here is long.

NOTE Confidence: 0.864132

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.668
When we add an S to dog and an S

NOTE Confidence: 0.864132

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:41.400
2 duck,

NOTE Confidence: 0.864132

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.940
we also have a different sound.

NOTE Confidence: 0.822448

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.662
In dog because of the G the S becomes as

NOTE Confidence: 0.822448

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.440
sound as in zed so we say dogs.

NOTE Confidence: 0.889751

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.290
You might not hear it,

NOTE Confidence: 0.889751

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.881
but there's a little bit of sound at the end

NOTE Confidence: 0.889751

00:05:58.963 --> 00:06:00.350
of that dogs now.

NOTE Confidence: 0.889751

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.760
This is different from Ducks,

NOTE Confidence: 0.889751

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.027
which has a sound or an S sound so there

NOTE Confidence: 0.889751

00:06:06.108 --> 00:06:07.660
is a pronunciation.

NOTE Confidence: 0.889751

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.302
Difference say this one short with a sound and this

NOTE Confidence: 0.889751

00:06:12.393 --> 00:06:14.850
one is longer with a sound.

NOTE Confidence: 0.943676

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.831
OK, great, so now let's look at some cultural questions

NOTE Confidence: 0.943676

00:06:18.904 --> 00:06:19.700
about dogs.

NOTE Confidence: 0.924944

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.140
OK so our next question what do North Americans think

NOTE Confidence: 0.924944

00:06:23.205 --> 00:06:26.061
of dogs and a lot of people in England think

NOTE Confidence: 0.924944

00:06:26.126 --> 00:06:29.890
about dogs this way in Australia and this isn't everybody,

NOTE Confidence: 0.924944

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.990
but this is what a lot of the population think?

NOTE Confidence: 0.924944

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.020
What is their opinion on dogs well let's get gizmo

NOTE Confidence: 0.924944

00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:39.600
to help me out gizmo come here?

NOTE Confidence: 0.90093

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.020
I'm going to pick him up.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6900664

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.230
Here we go OK. So,

NOTE Confidence: 0.938

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.094
in North American culture dogs like gizmo are often treated

NOTE Confidence: 0.938

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.470
like family members.

NOTE Confidence: 0.938

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.623
Some people even treat them as if they are there

NOTE Confidence: 0.938

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:55.280
children,

NOTE Confidence: 0.938

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.169
although this is not everybody but they really do care

NOTE Confidence: 0.938

00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:02.770
about their dogs and they treat them like family?

NOTE Confidence: 0.901594

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.157
Right This is gizmo's first time on camera so if

NOTE Confidence: 0.901594

00:07:06.228 --> 00:07:07.780
he's a little nervous.

NOTE Confidence: 0.901594

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.770
He's never been on camera before.

NOTE Confidence: 0.882284

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.310
Alright let's look at the next question small talk,

NOTE Confidence: 0.882284

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.430
so dogs are actually a really,

NOTE Confidence: 0.882284

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.040
really good. Oh, you want buddy economics down.

NOTE Confidence: 0.923456999999999

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.258
Sorry, OK, so dogs are actually really good topics for

NOTE Confidence: 0.923456999999999

00:07:25.336 --> 00:07:29.711
small talk if you ever have a conversation with somebody

NOTE Confidence: 0.923456999999999

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:33.460
and you see they have a dog talking about their

NOTE Confidence: 0.923457

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.240
dog is a great thing to do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.938665

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.096
So if you're in the elevator or at the park

NOTE Confidence: 0.938665

00:07:39.163 --> 00:07:42.219
and you just want to meet somebody you can ask

NOTE Confidence: 0.938665

00:07:42.285 --> 00:07:43.680
them about their dog.

NOTE Confidence: 0.938665

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.720
Here are some great questions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.938665

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.350
You can ask them what's your dogs name?

NOTE Confidence: 0.922054818181818

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.808
What's his name. Is your dog a boy or a

NOTE Confidence: 0.922054818181818

00:07:51.897 --> 00:07:52.340
girl?

NOTE Confidence: 0.915826

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.900
Is it a male or a female?

NOTE Confidence: 0.926243

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.560
How old is your dog?

NOTE Confidence: 0.926243

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.771
How long have you had your dog for OK so

NOTE Confidence: 0.926243

00:07:59.851 --> 00:08:02.420
another really good question is?

NOTE Confidence: 0.926243

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.526
What kind of dog do you have so in this

NOTE Confidence: 0.926243

00:08:05.605 --> 00:08:09.348
case were asking about the type or the breed so

NOTE Confidence: 0.926243

00:08:09.428 --> 00:08:13.330
there are many different breeds or types of dogs.

NOTE Confidence: 0.926243

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:19.580
There are Chihuahuas. There are German Shepherds Shepherds Poodles Dalmatians.

NOTE Confidence: 0.926243

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:24.046
There are tons of different types of dogs gizmo in

NOTE Confidence: 0.926243

00:08:24.135 --> 00:08:26.100
case you're wondering.

NOTE Confidence: 0.920437

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.791
That app so pappillon mix beautiful breed and so people

NOTE Confidence: 0.920437

00:08:29.858 --> 00:08:31.670
do like talking about this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.920437

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.815
You can ask them about their breed are they mix

NOTE Confidence: 0.920437

00:08:34.882 --> 00:08:38.428
are they a purebred which means they're only one kind

NOTE Confidence: 0.920437

00:08:38.495 --> 00:08:39.900
of dog like a poodle.

NOTE Confidence: 0.920437

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.360
There's so many different questions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.920437

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.950
You can ask about dogs,

NOTE Confidence: 0.920437

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:47.699
but it's something people really love talking about so I

NOTE Confidence: 0.920437

00:08:47.766 --> 00:08:50.845
highly recommend if you see a person who has a

NOTE Confidence: 0.920437

00:08:50.912 --> 00:08:51.180
pet.

NOTE Confidence: 0.920437

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:56.030
It's something that's a good thing to talk about.

NOTE Confidence: 0.894704

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.664
OK, so like I said our pets are like our

NOTE Confidence: 0.894704

00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:59.520
family here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.894704

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.530
Oh, thank you. Gizmo for that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.894704000000001

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.211
Kiss so one thing I wanted to say is that

NOTE Confidence: 0.894704000000001

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:07.220
a lot of the Times in North American culture.

NOTE Confidence: 0.894704

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.260
You'll actually see that dogs are indoor dogs.

NOTE Confidence: 0.894704

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.070
They're not, outside a lot.

NOTE Confidence: 0.894704

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:15.830
They're actually they actually stay inside with us a lot.

NOTE Confidence: 0.894704

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.220
Sometimes they sit on their couches.

NOTE Confidence: 0.894704000000001

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.819
And for some people they even like might share like

NOTE Confidence: 0.894704000000001

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.995
the same bed or they might sleep on the same

NOTE Confidence: 0.894704000000001

00:09:25.066 --> 00:09:26.830
bed that their owner has.

NOTE Confidence: 0.925094

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:30.374
Cultural thing that you might notice if you ever come

NOTE Confidence: 0.925094

00:09:30.441 --> 00:09:33.316
to Canada at or North America is that a lot

NOTE Confidence: 0.925094

00:09:33.383 --> 00:09:36.860
of dogs actually wear clothes here and gizmo is also

NOTE Confidence: 0.925094

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.894
he wears clothes, too, especially in the winter time because

NOTE Confidence: 0.925094

00:09:40.961 --> 00:09:42.440
it does get very cold,

NOTE Confidence: 0.925094

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.482
so a lot of dogs have winter boots and winter

NOTE Confidence: 0.925094

00:09:45.549 --> 00:09:46.090
jackets,

NOTE Confidence: 0.925094

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.109
so if you come here don't be surprised to see

NOTE Confidence: 0.925094

00:09:49.176 --> 00:09:52.530
that sometimes people dress up their dogs for fun.

NOTE Confidence: 0.925094

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.770
Other times, it's a necessity because it is very cold

NOTE Confidence: 0.925094

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.290
during the winter.

NOTE Confidence: 0.893783

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.120
