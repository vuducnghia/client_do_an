NOTE Confidence: 0.944779

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.275
Hello my name is Emma, an in today's video I

NOTE Confidence: 0.944779

00:00:03.349 --> 00:00:06.550
am going to teach you some key expressions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.944779

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.075
You can use when somebody tells you something that's not

NOTE Confidence: 0.944779

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:15.600
true and you want to argue against what they're saying.

NOTE Confidence: 0.945745

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.983
So, in this video I'm going to teach you these

NOTE Confidence: 0.945745

00:00:19.056 --> 00:00:20.380
great expressions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.945745

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.970
But before I do that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.945745

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.431
We're going to talk about 3 words that are very

NOTE Confidence: 0.945745

00:00:25.505 --> 00:00:26.830
common in English.

NOTE Confidence: 0.945745

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.363
These days, those 3 words are fake news conspiracy theories

NOTE Confidence: 0.945745

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.743
and hoax is so in this video you will learn

NOTE Confidence: 0.945745

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.510
what these words mean?

NOTE Confidence: 0.957194

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.964
And you will also learn what to say to somebody

NOTE Confidence: 0.957194

00:00:40.037 --> 00:00:43.050
that tells you something that's not true.

NOTE Confidence: 0.951244

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.390
Alright so let's get started.

NOTE Confidence: 0.924838

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.017
So I have here 3 sentence is the first sentence

NOTE Confidence: 0.924838

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:53.660
is scientists say the Earth is flat,

NOTE Confidence: 0.94551325

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.090
not round. Is this true or not true?

NOTE Confidence: 0.92423

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.490
OK, this sentence is not true some people believe this

NOTE Confidence: 0.92423

00:01:04.572 --> 00:01:06.120
but it is not true.

NOTE Confidence: 0.928394

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.367
My second sentence Michael Jackson is alive and living as

NOTE Confidence: 0.928394

00:01:12.476 --> 00:01:14.120
Kim Kardashian.

NOTE Confidence: 0.956601

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.370
True or not true.

NOTE Confidence: 0.931821

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.860
Again, we have a sentence that is not true I

NOTE Confidence: 0.931821

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:20.970
made this up.

NOTE Confidence: 0.930513

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.990
And finally my third sentence listening to rock music causes

NOTE Confidence: 0.930513

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.100
cancer is this true or untrue.

NOTE Confidence: 0.940117000000001

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.841
Again, this is untrue. I also made up this so

NOTE Confidence: 0.940117000000001

00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:37.166
my point here is that a lot of what you

NOTE Confidence: 0.940117000000001

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:40.990
hear from people in conversation is not true.

NOTE Confidence: 0.941344999999999

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.260
People say, these types of things all the time and

NOTE Confidence: 0.941344999999999

00:01:44.325 --> 00:01:47.726
you will know that this is something that's not true

NOTE Confidence: 0.941344999999999

00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:50.800
So what do you say when someone tells you that

NOTE Confidence: 0.941345

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.883
the earth is flat or they tell you that Michael

NOTE Confidence: 0.941345

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:56.310
Jackson is living as Kim Kardashian,

NOTE Confidence: 0.941345

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.244
so I will teach you those great expressions you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.941345

00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:00.630
use.

NOTE Confidence: 0.916223

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.616
Before I do that I wanted to just say that

NOTE Confidence: 0.916223

00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:09.740
these 3 sentence is can also be considered fake news.

NOTE Confidence: 0.928216

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.566
So we will look at the meaning of fake news

NOTE Confidence: 0.928216

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:13.420
in a moment.

NOTE Confidence: 0.914874

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.380
OK so the 3 main words,

NOTE Confidence: 0.914874

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.171
I wanted to teach you today are words that you

NOTE Confidence: 0.914874

00:02:19.254 --> 00:02:22.633
will see a lot on the Internet and in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.914874

00:02:22.715 --> 00:02:23.210
media.

NOTE Confidence: 0.914874

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.017
The first word is fake news So what is fake

NOTE Confidence: 0.914874

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:29.850
news while fake means not true?

NOTE Confidence: 0.931647

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.161
Fake news is news stories that are not true and

NOTE Confidence: 0.931647

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:37.280
their created to damage a person,

NOTE Confidence: 0.931647

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.218
a business. An agency or government or they might also

NOTE Confidence: 0.931647

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.700
be created to get attention and to get clicks on

NOTE Confidence: 0.931647

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:47.980
the Internet.

NOTE Confidence: 0.931647

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.111
So you'll see a lot of fake news on different

NOTE Confidence: 0.931647

00:02:52.203 --> 00:02:54.590
social media like Twitter,

NOTE Confidence: 0.931647

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.250
Facebook and a lot of other places to online.

NOTE Confidence: 0.940307

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.670
So this is very common word these days a lot

NOTE Confidence: 0.940307

00:03:02.725 --> 00:03:03.990
of people are using it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.940307

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.250
So it's important that you know what it means.

NOTE Confidence: 0.945177

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.280
We also have the word here,

NOTE Confidence: 0.958174333333333

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.600
conspiracy theory. So a conspiracy theory.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9333597

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.151
Is an explanation? Of an event or situation that is

NOTE Confidence: 0.9333597

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.952
different from the official account alot of the Times conspiracy

NOTE Confidence: 0.9333597

00:03:25.041 --> 00:03:31.020
theories are about government or a business doing something illegal

NOTE Confidence: 0.933392

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.371
or to harm someone so let's think of some conspiracy

NOTE Confidence: 0.933392

00:03:36.474 --> 00:03:37.400
theories.

NOTE Confidence: 0.946508

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.050
Some people believe that the moon landing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.946508

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.115
So when when astronauts went to the moon in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.946508

00:03:45.201 --> 00:03:45.720
1960s.

NOTE Confidence: 0.946508

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.200
Some people believe the moon landing was fake.

NOTE Confidence: 0.966716

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.500
This is a popular conspiracy theory.

NOTE Confidence: 0.947399000000001

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.380
Another conspiracy theory, I heard recently is some people believe

NOTE Confidence: 0.947399000000001

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:06.636
that Paul McCartney from The Beatles actually died in 1966

NOTE Confidence: 0.947399000000001

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:11.090
and there is a different man who replaced him and

NOTE Confidence: 0.947399

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.840
who is actually the better musician so this is a

NOTE Confidence: 0.947399

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.710
different conspiracy theory.

NOTE Confidence: 0.960125

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.364
So you'll see a lot of conspiracy theories on the

NOTE Confidence: 0.960125

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:23.110
Internet.

NOTE Confidence: 0.946453

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.410
And a lot of people will tell you conspiracy theories

NOTE Confidence: 0.946453

00:04:26.472 --> 00:04:27.780
during conversations.

NOTE Confidence: 0.882874

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.618
The last word I wanted to teach you was the

NOTE Confidence: 0.882874

00:04:31.707 --> 00:04:32.600
word hoax.

NOTE Confidence: 0.831062130434782

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.291
Hoax so a hoax. Is a type of practical joke

NOTE Confidence: 0.831062130434782

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.746
that is meant to embarrass or hurt people so some

NOTE Confidence: 0.831062130434782

00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:44.710
examples of hoax?

NOTE Confidence: 0.897647

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.938
Is our you'll have these death hoax is where they'll

NOTE Confidence: 0.897647

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:50.970
say a celebrity is dead,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897646999999999

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.443
but it's not true, it's a joke or you might

NOTE Confidence: 0.897646999999999

00:04:54.524 --> 00:04:58.482
have a hoax like some people might take a picture

NOTE Confidence: 0.897646999999999

00:04:58.563 --> 00:05:02.440
of an alien or a monster and tell everyone look.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897647

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.890
We have evidence of this monster or alien,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897647

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.000
but if it's not true then it's.

NOTE Confidence: 0.895726

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.960
It's a joke of practical joke.

NOTE Confidence: 0.929552

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.576
So again fake news conspiracy theories an hoax is are

NOTE Confidence: 0.929552

00:05:15.644 --> 00:05:19.124
very common on the Internet and so for these things

NOTE Confidence: 0.929552

00:05:19.192 --> 00:05:20.420
that are not true?

NOTE Confidence: 0.929552

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.774
What do you say to people when they tell you

NOTE Confidence: 0.929552

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.680
this untrue information?

NOTE Confidence: 0.907878

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.840
Well let's find out in a moment.

NOTE Confidence: 0.931131

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.506
OK, so you've heard a fake news story or conspiracy

NOTE Confidence: 0.931131

00:05:31.578 --> 00:05:32.800
theory or a hoax.

NOTE Confidence: 0.931131

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.160
Maybe your aunt or your friend just told you it

NOTE Confidence: 0.931131

00:05:36.231 --> 00:05:39.091
an you know it's not true So what do you

NOTE Confidence: 0.931131

00:05:39.162 --> 00:05:40.020
say to them?

NOTE Confidence: 0.931131

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.910
Well, what you can do is you can challenge their

NOTE Confidence: 0.931131

00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:44.720
argument?

NOTE Confidence: 0.949072

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.920
So for example, you can say.

NOTE Confidence: 0.938487

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.350
So let me get this straight you're saying and you

NOTE Confidence: 0.938487

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.240
can repeat what they said.

NOTE Confidence: 0.954434

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.680
So let me get this straight you're saying Paul McCartney

NOTE Confidence: 0.954434

00:05:58.777 --> 00:06:00.040
died in 1966.

NOTE Confidence: 0.918561

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.440
And then what you can say is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.938018

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.640
And say that's not true.

NOTE Confidence: 0.96600375

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.870
That's inaccurate. I find that hard to believe.

NOTE Confidence: 0.959987111111111

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.630
That doesn't make sense. So these are all expressions,

NOTE Confidence: 0.948708

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.400
we use when we're saying I don't believe you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919621

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.632
Now, if we wanted to say something that was a

NOTE Confidence: 0.919621

00:06:22.704 --> 00:06:24.500
little bit more impolite.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919621

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.800
We can use the word BS as in that's BS.

NOTE Confidence: 0.885474

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.417
BS stands for bullshit an sometimes we don't want to

NOTE Confidence: 0.885474

00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:36.768
swear so we might just say to our friends that's

NOTE Confidence: 0.885474

00:06:36.857 --> 00:06:38.810
total BS or that's BS.

NOTE Confidence: 0.932533

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.710
You can also say to somebody that's ridiculous,

NOTE Confidence: 0.932533

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.010
meaning that's that's a stupid story.

NOTE Confidence: 0.932533

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.850
That's ridiculous it's not true.

NOTE Confidence: 0.947473

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.550
So these are all examples of common things.

NOTE Confidence: 0.947473

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.589
People say when someone tells them something that they don't

NOTE Confidence: 0.947473

00:06:53.656 --> 00:06:56.954
believe so now let's look at some other things we

NOTE Confidence: 0.947473

00:06:57.022 --> 00:07:00.320
can say when somebody tells us a fake news story.

NOTE Confidence: 0.942374000000001

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.165
OK, so another thing you can do when somebody tells

NOTE Confidence: 0.942374000000001

00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:05.955
you fake news or something that's not true is you

NOTE Confidence: 0.942374000000001

00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:08.800
can ask them where their sources or where did they

NOTE Confidence: 0.921138285714285

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.246
get the information from? So this is the big where

NOTE Confidence: 0.921138285714285

00:07:13.335 --> 00:07:18.225
question when we talk about sources or new sources were

NOTE Confidence: 0.921138285714285

00:07:18.314 --> 00:07:21.960
talking about who said it so for example,

NOTE Confidence: 0.917599

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.630
maybe the news came from your mom.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915154

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.170
So maybe that's not a great source.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915154

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.220
Maybe it came from BBC News.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915154

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.563
Or maybe it came from wika pedia or Facebook or

NOTE Confidence: 0.915154

00:07:33.634 --> 00:07:36.764
if you're in science is maybe it came from a

NOTE Confidence: 0.915154

00:07:36.835 --> 00:07:38.400
peer reviewed Journal.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915154

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.756
Maybe it came from Twitter or your aunt or your

NOTE Confidence: 0.915154

00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:44.470
friends so it's good to ask somebody.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915154

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.030
Where did they get the information from?

NOTE Confidence: 0.915487

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:52.327
And then you can think about OK is that a

NOTE Confidence: 0.915487

00:07:52.432 --> 00:07:53.690
good source.

NOTE Confidence: 0.91256

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.780
And a lot of the times it probably isn't.

NOTE Confidence: 0.904334

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.280
And you can tell them this OK,

NOTE Confidence: 0.904334

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.350
so if somebody tells you for example,

NOTE Confidence: 0.904334

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:06.657
that the moon landing didn't happen and there's a big

NOTE Confidence: 0.904334

00:08:06.738 --> 00:08:11.370
conspiracy and aliens control the US and Canada and China

NOTE Confidence: 0.904334

00:08:11.451 --> 00:08:14.620
but you can say to them is who told you

NOTE Confidence: 0.904334

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.570
that? Where is your news source and if they say,

NOTE Confidence: 0.904334

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.674
Oh, my friend Gary told me that well then you

NOTE Confidence: 0.904334

00:08:22.765 --> 00:08:26.230
can say that's not a good news source.

NOTE Confidence: 0.883448

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:31.894
You can also ask them why or how questions so

NOTE Confidence: 0.883448

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.530
for example,

NOTE Confidence: 0.845369

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:37.830
you know why would. You know.

NOTE Confidence: 0.911650037037037

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:42.237
Let's start with how. How would the government cover that

NOTE Confidence: 0.911650037037037

00:08:42.314 --> 00:08:46.025
up or how would rock and roll music cause cancer

NOTE Confidence: 0.911650037037037

00:08:46.102 --> 00:08:49.040
so you can always ask these questions?

NOTE Confidence: 0.923397

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.810
Why and how an you know,

NOTE Confidence: 0.923397

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.370
maybe they have a good explanation.

NOTE Confidence: 0.923397

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.474
But it's good to ask these questions to find out

NOTE Confidence: 0.923397

00:08:57.559 --> 00:09:01.150
more about why they think what they think.

NOTE Confidence: 0.907266

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:05.780
You can also counter what they're saying meaning if they

NOTE Confidence: 0.907266

00:09:05.863 --> 00:09:07.020
say something,

NOTE Confidence: 0.907266

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.508
and you disagree you can say your opinion so for

NOTE Confidence: 0.907266

00:09:11.602 --> 00:09:12.350
example.

NOTE Confidence: 0.936624

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:18.245
If somebody told you that Kim Kardashian is really Michael

NOTE Confidence: 0.936624

00:09:18.347 --> 00:09:19.160
Jackson.

NOTE Confidence: 0.940076

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.394
You can say the fact of the matter is Michael

NOTE Confidence: 0.940076

00:09:23.488 --> 00:09:25.370
Jackson passed away.

NOTE Confidence: 0.903908

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.900
He is not Kim Kardashian.

NOTE Confidence: 0.932038

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.916
The truth is Michael Jackson and Kim Kardashian or not

NOTE Confidence: 0.932038

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.180
the same person.

NOTE Confidence: 0.932038

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.300
You can also say in reality.

NOTE Confidence: 0.932038

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.540
In reality, Michael Jackson is not Kim Kardashian.

NOTE Confidence: 0.917852

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.560
So these are great expressions,

NOTE Confidence: 0.917852

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.070
you can use when you're trying to tell somebody that

NOTE Confidence: 0.917852

00:09:46.137 --> 00:09:50.187
what they're saying is incorrect and that what you're saying

NOTE Confidence: 0.917852

00:09:50.255 --> 00:09:51.740
is the correct belief.

NOTE Confidence: 0.943783

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.682
OK so we've gone over all these different things to

NOTE Confidence: 0.943783

00:09:54.739 --> 00:09:54.970
say.

NOTE Confidence: 0.943783

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.875
When somebody tells you something that's not true so let's

NOTE Confidence: 0.943783

00:09:58.942 --> 00:09:59.750
practice it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.91498

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:04.080
OK, this just in fake news story.

NOTE Confidence: 0.913914

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:10.509
Did you hear terrorists have melted Antarctica using a giant

NOTE Confidence: 0.913914

00:10:10.616 --> 00:10:11.580
laser OK,

NOTE Confidence: 0.913914

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:18.510
so terrorists have melted Antarctica using a gigantic laser?

NOTE Confidence: 0.901569

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.370
So that's the news story,

NOTE Confidence: 0.901569

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.940
which I just made up.

NOTE Confidence: 0.901569

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.330
It's fake news. So, your source is Emma.

NOTE Confidence: 0.908818

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.091
And this is not a good source for this news

NOTE Confidence: 0.908818

00:10:28.155 --> 00:10:28.540
story.

NOTE Confidence: 0.908818

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.083
So what can you say to me if I give

NOTE Confidence: 0.908818

00:10:31.155 --> 00:10:33.480
you a fake news story like that?

NOTE Confidence: 0.887351

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.907
Or maybe you'll say that's not true you might say

NOTE Confidence: 0.887351

00:10:39.018 --> 00:10:42.230
where did you hear that Emma?

NOTE Confidence: 0.905952

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:46.810
Why would terrorists melt Antarctica with a giant laser?

NOTE Confidence: 0.905952

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.953
How would terrorists get the laser so you might ask

NOTE Confidence: 0.905952

00:10:51.034 --> 00:10:55.340
these questions and then you might tell me the truth.

NOTE Confidence: 0.905952

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.349
The fact of the matter is an Arctica has not

NOTE Confidence: 0.905952

00:10:59.441 --> 00:11:03.450
been melted by terrorists that is fake news.

NOTE Confidence: 0.932238

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:07.179

NOTE Confidence: 0.932238

00:11:10.646 --> 00:11:12.020
or conspiracy theory.

NOTE Confidence: 0.932238

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.955
Also, maybe some expressions you can use when you hear

NOTE Confidence: 0.932238

00:11:16.028 --> 00:11:17.850
something that is untrue.
