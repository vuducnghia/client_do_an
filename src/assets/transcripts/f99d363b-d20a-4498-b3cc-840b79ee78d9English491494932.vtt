1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.500
for most of the Year bison bulls

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.600
and cows live separate lives but
for a few weeks in late summer

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:17.000
thousands congregate in this
Yellowstone Valley it's the rut

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.400
The Mating Season and the
biggest Bulls are busy guarding

5
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.200
their hareem's

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.700
a dominant bull might make with
over 50 females

7
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:38.200
for the calves born this year
now is the time to stretch their

8
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.300
young legs but as the HUD grows
so tensions rise

9
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:30.100
the rut takes a heavy toll all
on the big balls so arriving now

10
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.100
could give this young Contender
and Edge

11
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.300
but there's life in the old bull
yet

12
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:16.700
I had to head the Challenger
more than hold his own and he

13
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.100
makes a small mistake

14
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.100
shunted aside his challenge is
brutally ending

15
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:47.800
the young bull gamble everything
and has paid a heavy price
